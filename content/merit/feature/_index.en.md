### Andaze Features

**We are a company that makes full use of global IT technology across borders. The speed of our development and the highest level of quality are unparalleled, and we have brought about numerous innovations.** 

{{< tableofcontent >}}

#### Providing start-up development speed with corporate rules.

After graduating from university, our CEO, Mr. Arai, studied management information systems at a foreign automobile manufacturer. Later, he moved to India to study IT solutions in earnest. However, the mainstream there was software development for major companies, which valued "following a plan rather than the content of the product. Arai had doubts about this and returned to Japan. Wanting to provide Japanese companies with speedy development, he started Andaze.  
This is because, while many companies want to go digital, they say they don't know how to ask for help. Even if they find a company to outsource the work, the budget and delivery date may be far from what they expected, or they may only focus on nominal business improvement effects. I think the reason why such discrepancies occur is because many IT projects place the highest priority on planning and budgeting, which Arai witnessed in India.  
Andaze has released numerous sophisticated software products in a short period of time. By adopting innovative development frameworks and preparing the latest software development environment, we select clients who trust us and projects that we can lead with initiative. In addition, we support our clients' "digital shift" within the scope of social rules, morals, and compliance at the level of large corporations.

- **Find gaps that could be digitized and make suggestions.**
- **Provide prototypes more quickly than design documents.**
- **The impact of the product is immensely more important than budget or delivery time.**
- **Develop new products rather than expanding existing systems**
- **Make corrections and improvements based on learning and discovery.**

IT projects never have to be exactly as planned. IT projects never have to be exactly as planned; it's how many iterations of revisions you make while adapting to the situation and feedback. We believe that the shortcut to success is to build prototypes and improvements in a sustainable environment, and to move closer to potential needs.

#### Crisis management skills trusted by listed companies and government agencies
The organization's information security has been certified to ISO 27001, the international standard for ISMS (Information Security Management System). By maintaining and improving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in a balanced manner, we have earned the trust of our clients.

#### Providing technology from English-speaking countries that are leading the way in IT in Japanese

English-speaking countries are home to some of the world's most talented engineers, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft, all of which originated in the United States. It is also said that people whose mother tongue is English are blessed with an environment where they can learn IT knowledge, such as programming languages written in English, from an early age, making it easier for them to grow up to be active on the front lines. We provide IT know-how from overseas, where new technologies are being created every day, in Japanese. We are creating services that incorporate the latest global technologies that have not yet penetrated Japan.

#### Multinational teams bring out the strengths of the right people in the right places

Andaze is made up of multinational members from Japan, India and other countries. By working on system development with an international team, each of us is able to specialize in our own field. For example, technical development is one of the jobs where Indians can maximize their strengths. For example, technical development is one of the jobs where Indians can maximize their strengths, while communication with clients is the domain of Myanmarese and Japanese who have a culture of bowing. Vietnamese are less biased and can handle multiple tasks relatively well. In this way, by utilizing the strengths of each individual, the right person can play an active role in the right place, or in other words, "optimization of skills" can be achieved.

#### Reduce risks and costs by decentralizing work locations and data
Our employees are dispersed between Japan and India for work. This is because software development can be done remotely and data can be sent in an instant, so there is no need to work in the same space. Also, each of us can work while living in our home country, and living in an area where the cost of living is lower than in Japan has the advantage of keeping costs down.  
In addition, data is distributed between western and eastern Japan, Singapore, and the east coast of the United States. This reduces the concentration of load on the servers and increases the ability of the system to operate stably.
