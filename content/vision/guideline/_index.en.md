### **Two Action Guidelines**
&nbsp;
###### In order to spread our vision and identity throughout the company, and to set the "prerequisites" for our staff to work, we have prepared two types of behavioral guidelines. I believe that these guidelines will give you an idea of the kind of values we work with.

#### **Baisi's Action Guidelines**

###### It is a code of conduct that should be pursued equally by all staff. We may not always act honorably, but thanks to the code of conduct, we are able to work with a common understanding.

&nbsp;
##### **Professionals are action-oriented.**

* Don't justify not taking action. Not acting is a risk and an evil.

* Act with a goal. Action without a goal is useless action.

* There are only two kinds of people in this world: those who are busy but act, and those who are not busy but do not act. It is natural to be busy. When you can't manage your busyness, you are lazy.

* Not acting under the guise of modesty and prudence is only indulging our lazy selves.

* In order to act, you must move others. Actions that do not affect others are meaningless.

* Don't expect immediate results from your actions. The bigger the result, the more you can get by continuing to act.

* Once you take action, don't give up easily until you achieve your goal. Failure is determined when you give up.

* Always evaluate the results of your actions. The evaluation criteria are the degree of goal achievement and the degree of impact on others.

&nbsp;

##### **Professionals are logical.**
* Logical is a state in which issues, evidence, and conclusions are connected without difficulty.

* "Why? "What exactly? Always expect to be asked "Why? Conclusions that cannot be answered are not logical.

* Always draw your own conclusions. You can't train your logical thinking because you leave it to others.

* Don't come to conclusions based on your personal preferences and experiences. That's what arrogant and ignorant people do.

* Keep your rationale to no more than three, so that the story is organized and conveyed.

* Don't be vague in your conclusions. Conclusions that are filled with abstract words are usually not effective.

* Don't discard your emotions, even if they are logical. Emotions are part of the rationale. They should be evaluated objectively.

* Use logic that they can understand. Logic that the other person does not understand is meaningless.

&nbsp;

##### **Professionals are self-reliant.**
* Think of the problem as your own fault. People who think it's the environment or other people's fault will never grow up.

* It's not your fault that the weather is bad, but it is your fault that you don't feel good because of it. Thinking of ways to improve results even when the weather is bad is a self-blame type of thinking.

* Why don't I have the skills I want now? It's the other-blame type that thinks, "I didn't have that opportunity before," "They didn't let me do that kind of work," "I was too busy," or "I was unlucky. It is the self-blame type that thinks it was a lack of effort on their part and immediately does what they can.

* Don't be satisfied with effort without result. You are always in a state of lack of effort until you reach the desired result.

* Job satisfaction and ease of working are things you make yourself. It is not something that the company or your seniors can give you.

* Miscommunication is not the fault of the other person. It's the way you communicate.

* The less capable we are, the more we are affected by our environment. Complaining is an act of exposing one's incompetence.

* The present is the result of your choices. The future depends on the choices you make in the future. It is all your responsibility.

&nbsp;

##### **Professionals have leadership skills.**
* Don't think that someone else will solve it for you. Always work with the idea that you will solve it.

* If something can be solved on the spot, solve it on the spot. Putting things off without a reason is just laziness.

* Don't make a move until you see what someone else looks like or does. Such people are usually late to the party.

* If it's always the same, be the first to move. Leadership does not grow in people who prefer to follow others.

* People without leadership tend to wait. Act on your own and reduce the waiting as much as possible.

* Be proactive in meetings. A silent person is no more valuable than a houseplant.

* Don't run away from taking the initiative. That's why you'll always be unreliable.

* Always act with confidence and be assertive. No one will follow you if you are not confident.

&nbsp;

##### **Professionals keep improving their skills.**
* Don't just hold on to the skills you've acquired so far. That's what stops you from growing.

* Don't compare yourself to the average person. Compare yourself to the best people and try to get closer to them.

* Set your goals high. Being satisfied with low goals is typical of people who do not grow.

* Look at the good side of things. People who only see the bad side of things and only criticize will only think about avoiding failure and become timid and inactive. Seeing the good side of things makes you more active and allows you to grow.

* Learning without output is not learning. Skills are determined by the amount of knowledge and the amount of output.

* Learn from your private life. A career plan that completely separates public and private life is inefficient.

* Distinguish between the skills you need now and the skills you will need in the future. The day will come when growth stops for those who cannot be aware of this.

* The skills you will need in the future are usually less urgent and will not cause problems if you don't act on them right away. This is the trap. Only those who keep themselves busy now will get the skills they need in the future.

&nbsp;

##### **Professionals are witty.**
* Don't focus on what you want to say. Speak in a way that makes the other person feel more comfortable.

* Be interested in the person you are talking to and actively ask questions. Indifference to others is the greatest insult of all.

* To be thoughtful means to show interest in and support others in their areas of responsibility. Stubbornly carrying out only one's own area of responsibility is the work of an inconsiderate person.

* When the other person asks you a question, the document or email is not clever enough. Put yourself in the other person's shoes, and be thorough in making sure it is easy to understand and comprehend.

* It is not an act of cleverness to add lengthy explanations to difficult things. Making difficult things simple and easy to understand is an act of thoughtfulness.

* Always think and act in a way that makes others feel comfortable. Don't just think about completing your own work.

* Be considerate of others' feelings and show understanding of their actions. From understanding comes smooth communication and suggestions for improvement.

* Don't make communication formulaic. Formalization stops thinking and dilutes the awareness of the problem.

&nbsp;

##### **Professionals are user-oriented.**
* Think about the benefits that every piece of content, function, and design gives to the user. Websites without merit will not be used by users in the end.

* Verify whether users really want the benefits you have considered. The benefits that companies and creators assume on their own will not lead to results.

* Reconsider whether the client's request is truly from the user's perspective. Websites from a corporate perspective will fail.

* Have the insight to not miss even a 1px discrepancy or a 0.1 second discomfort. The accumulation of details affects the quality of the user experience.

* Libraries," "browser specifications," "source code consistency," and "design disruption" are for the convenience of the creator. Think about the best solution based on the merits and demerits of the user, not on the constraints.

* Become a user yourself and actively use the world's websites. A person with little user experience cannot create a superior user experience.

* Don't take your personal experiences and impressions as user experiences. It's usually an assumption. User experience is something that can be seen from a fairer perspective.

&nbsp;

##### **Professionals learn from their mistakes.**
* Think about the root cause and scope of the failure. Thinly veiled considerations that merely grasp the events that occurred are pointless.

* Think of other people's failures as your failures. The more failures you experience, the faster you will grow.

* Consider that failure comes with pain. Pain is what allows us to learn from our mistakes.

* To improve failures, think in terms of concrete processes, not in terms of psychology. Mentalism means stopping thinking.

* If you make a mistake, immediately think about the cause and take immediate action. There is nothing more foolish than letting a failure lie.

* Don't neglect your efforts to turn failures into opportunities. The response to failure is the best opportunity to gain trust.

* If you fail, try again. If you run away from the risk of failure, your failure will remain a failure.
