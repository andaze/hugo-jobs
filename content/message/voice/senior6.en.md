##### **`This is who I am.`**

###### After borrowing a friend's bike for touring, I started riding a road bike as a sport a few years ago, and have participated in endurance races at stadiums and hill climb races where I rode all the way up the mountain. On weekends when the weather is nice, I often ride on the cycling path along the Tama River. I like to listen to music, and used to buy a lot of analog records of HOUSE, HIPHOP, and soul music, but recently I am looking forward to discovering new music through streaming services such as Spotify and Amazon's Prime Music.

##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### Although we are a small organization for a web production company, we have a group of professionals in various fields, all of whom are working to achieve high quality and results for our clients' business while improving their skills every day. Because we are a small organization, we have close communication within the company, and by working on projects while supporting each other in roles other than our own, we are able to acquire a wide range of knowledge and know-how that transcends job categories. I joined Bayesi as a mid-career hire, and it was an opportunity for me to clarify my strengths and many weaknesses that I had acquired through my previous working experience, and to change my mindset. I promise you that you will become a creator who is not affected by the changing times and environment, because you will acquire not short-term skills, but skills that are universally useful in your work.
