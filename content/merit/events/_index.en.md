#### **Daily Report**
&nbsp;
###### It is compulsory to submit a daily report before the end of the workday. You can write about anything you want. The amount of text is also free. The only restriction is that the report must be tied to the action guidelines. This is for the purpose of verbalization skills, ability to organize thoughts, penetration of the action guidelines, and internal communication. Even those who are not good at writing at the time of joining the company will develop their writing skills within a couple of months and be able to write in a short time. Some of the daily reports are published on an owned media called "Daily Report Site".

#### **Project Meeting**
&nbsp;
###### Every Friday from 4:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., we check the progress of each project. We check the progress of each project and immediately make adjustments if there is any unreasonable schedule. By sharing the progress of all the projects in operation with all the staff, we can prevent confusion caused by multiple projects clashing or unexpected schedule changes.

#### **Weekly meeting**
&nbsp;
###### After confirming each person's tasks for the following week at the project meeting on Friday, we will review each person's schedule for the week on the following Monday from 1:30 to 2:00 pm. While the project meeting is to check the progress of each project, the weekly meeting is to review the previous week and share the work schedule for that week. By using both project meetings and weekly meetings, we are able to monitor the work status of all employees and take immediate action against those who are likely to work long hours.

#### **JS Study Group**
&nbsp;
###### This is a monthly study session held by inviting lecturers from outside the company, planned because there was a sense of weakness in JavaScript among the engineers. Each month an assignment is presented, which is reviewed and explained by the instructor, and in addition to JavaScript programming, the assignments also include language-independent universal topics such as algorithms and design concepts for physical animation. This study session has dramatically improved the engineers' proficiency in JavaScript.

#### **Study session by job category**
&nbsp;
###### In addition to the JS study group, in-house study groups are also held once every one or two weeks for different job categories such as directors, designers, and engineers. The themes vary depending on the job category, but we exchange information and discuss what we have learned in our work and the latest trends. Bayzi has an organizational structure with a wide range of ages and experience, from veterans to new graduates, and these study sessions play a role in absorbing the gaps in experience and knowledge.

#### **President's study meeting**
&nbsp;
###### UX, BtoB marketing, strategy framework, log analysis, copywriting, document design, introduction of past strategy proposals, etc. We share information and conduct workshops in areas that are not often covered in job-specific study groups.

#### **Closing meeting**
&nbsp;
###### This is a meeting that takes place within a week or two after the project is completed, with all members of the project. The issues and problems of the project are discussed, specific improvement measures are derived, deadlines are set for the improvement measures, and improvements are made to the workflow and documentation. By making project failures and problems into know-how, we are implementing this system with the aim of creating a system where both people and the organization grow the more they work.

#### **Younger employees only 1-on-1**
&nbsp;
###### This is a short 1-on-1 interview for young staff in their 20s, conducted by staff in their 30s and above. We don't talk about work here, but rather about what is troubling or troubling them. This is a place where young employees who are not able to speak up can be asked again, "Do you have any problems? This is to prevent them from feeling alone. Although not everyone speaks their mind, just having such a place to talk is a relief, and it has been a relatively popular initiative.

#### **Annual Interviews / Semi-regular Interviews / Occasional Interviews**
&nbsp;
###### Interviews are held in December every year to review the past year and discuss goals for the following year, what the company is looking for, what the employee wants to do, and what issues need to be addressed. Salary negotiations for the following year are also held at this meeting. The contents of the annual meeting are also discussed in the semi-annual meeting, and other irregular meetings are held depending on the situation. The system is designed in such a way that management and employees can communicate closely with each other and never be in a situation where they do not know what each other is thinking. We believe that quantifying individual skills and behaviors is not effective, so we are currently using a document called the "Skill x Evaluation Relative Chart" as the basis for our interviews, aiming for evaluations that are satisfactory to both parties.

#### **Bage summit**
&nbsp;
###### This is an event that is held once a year. It is a place to think and talk about the company's issues, mission, future vision, and life planning, using a whole day of work time. We also have study sessions where we watch videos, workshops on new services, etc., and a party is held in the evening. This event is held with the aim of aligning values between the company and its employees, so that they can work in the same direction.

#### **Work hour restrictions**
&nbsp;
###### We are required to leave the office at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesdays to avoid having a full week and losing time for personal life and study. On Wednesdays, we must leave the office by 9:00 p.m. at the latest. You will not be required to work on holidays unless you have to, and if you do, you will be able to take a make-up day off. Some web production companies require you to take the last train every day, stay up all night, or work on holidays, but this rarely happens at Baisi.

#### **Document Formatting**
&nbsp;
###### Many of the 140 tasks that make up a workflow have documents associated with them, and most of them have a format. Various documents related to project management, proposals, analysis reports, various guidelines, check sheets, lists for management, and other frequently used documents are formatted and framed to pursue a highly productive way of working that reduces the burden of routine work.
