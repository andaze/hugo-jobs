##### **`This is who I am.`**

###### I like to look at and create websites, and I often spend my days off with my friends thinking about services and creating websites. I also like music, especially listening to artists belonging to Office Augusta, such as Masayoshi Yamazaki and Tomoyuki Nagasawa. Last year, I also participated in the Augusta Camp. When I got a job, I moved from Kyoto to Tokyo and started living by myself. I try to cook for myself in the morning and evening, but my repertoire is still limited, and I spend my days eating green curry and Tianjin rice.

##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### The environment is very conducive to communication with all employees, including the president. I can directly express my opinions and requests, and if there is anything I don't understand, I can directly consult with my experienced seniors. With their thorough support, I now find it very rewarding to work as a team. There is also active information sharing within the company, such as exchanging information on recommended books, blogs, and the latest technologies, as well as introducing events and seminars, so regardless of your field of expertise, you can always come into contact with new information. Although it requires a lot of effort, I feel that this is a safe environment even if you have no experience.
