### Training Policy
**What we are adopting is a management approach that does not depend on time or place. We do not talk about old-fashioned gut feelings. We create an environment for growth through objective judgment and fair relationships.**

#### "Take responsibility for the lives of those who work at Andaz."
We provide a place where each and every one of our members can feel free to express their opinions and ideas without worry or anxiety, and where they can work as themselves in the long run. 

①Do not impose your personal values.    
Most of the old stories about "how things were when I was young" are outdated and inapplicable to people living in the present moment. In this age of diversity, there are many correct answers and means. Teaching with stories of past experiences is just "imposition" and does not help.

②Don't give detailed instructions for everything.    
You may think you are advising the right answer, but detailed instructions deprive your subordinate of the opportunity to learn. If you want your subordinates to grow, it is important to let them make mistakes at times and use their own experience to find the answers. Of course, when they have questions, answer them properly.

③We dialogue in terms of numbers and other facts.      
We do not engage in dialogue based on "how hard we worked. We don't let meetings drag on and on. This is because we are able to manage the results of our employees numerically.

④Create a fair place to work.     
It is difficult to be active in a workplace where some people are given special treatment by their superiors. We will provide a place where anyone can challenge fairly based on objective facts, not subjective likes and dislikes by individuals.

#### Evaluate by objective numbers, not by "effort".
Arguing about "working hard/not working hard" or "having motivation/not having motivation" will make your business unstable because those things could be turned upside down tomorrow. Instead, **manage and train employees using objective indicators such as numbers**. There are often bosses who only care for their favorite subordinates or impose their own values on them, but their poor advice can sometimes be a "drag. We treat our employees fairly. We treat our employees fairly, but we don't take them by the hand and train them to lead them in the right direction. We want our employees to be people who are willing to learn from practical studies rather than reading textbooks. And we will train engineers who can move with profits and needs so that healthy competition based on facts will be created.

#### Conditions for supervisors to foster top-notch engineers
**What Anders thinks a good boss is**  
- Leave process management to subordinates. 
- Have them report progress numerically. 
- Quantify "contribution" and "operation". 
- Manage "requirements, progress, and quality". 
- Identify and point out problems. 
- Subordinates are driven by profit. 
- Evaluation is based only on achievement or non-achievement.

In order to realize the vision and mission of Andaz, there are three action guidelines that we tell our employees. If you can put these into practice, you can become a technician, manager, or executive who can work anywhere.
