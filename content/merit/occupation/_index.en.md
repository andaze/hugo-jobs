### **Occupation Introduction**
&nbsp;
###### Since we undertake the entire process of web development, from strategy to development, we have all the skills to complete it. Here are some definitions of job functions that appear in internal conversations. However, we do not believe that all employees need to follow these uniform job definitions. For example, even if you have the same title of "director," the skills you acquire are not one and the same for each person. Rather than imposing a standardized skill set based on job titles, the system is structured so that each person can work freely according to their own wishes and aptitudes.

#### **Project Manager**
&nbsp;
###### It is sometimes abbreviated to PM. This position is responsible for budget management, team organization, WBS creation, security-related settings, internal communication, and legal procedures. While most of the work is done when a project is launched, they are also responsible for resource allocation, budget management, and schedule adjustment during the project's progress. There is no full-time project manager at Vage, but rather a director who also serves as a project manager.
##### Main Responsibilities : Imanishi, Odate, Gonoi, Furunaga

#### **consultant**
&nbsp;
###### This position is responsible for overseeing the strategic and creative aspects of a project, acting as the brains of the project and pursuing the marketing quality of the website. In particular, they play a central role in the strategy phase. The current consultants at Vage are primarily responsible for marketing, UX research and analytics, but may also include project management, creative direction, design and copywriting. This is the type of position that requires the most breadth of knowledge and strategic thinking at Vage. 
##### Main Responsibilities : (Tree) Valley, Oikan, Kucho

#### **UX Researcher**
&nbsp;
###### The main purpose of this position is to improve UX, from behavioral observation, user testing, online research, persona/journeying, workshop management, and idea generation. Research targets and methods are slightly different for web development and web applications. In web production, which has a strong marketing nature, the main focus is on analyzing prospective clients (leads) and customers rather than users. On the other hand, UI design for business systems, which is what we are starting to work on at Baisi, uses the so-called UX design approach. work related to UX can rarely be done by just thinking about UX, but rather it needs to be combined with management strategy, business strategy, capability, etc. I believe that if you don't think about management strategy, business strategy, capability, etc. in combination, you will not be able to come up with ideas that can be implemented. For this reason, we do not have a UX researcher as a specialized position within the company, but rather a consultant whose duties encompass all aspects of UX research.
##### Main Responsibilities :  (Tree) Valley, Imazai, Ohyakata

#### **director**
&nbsp;
###### Strictly speaking, this position focuses on production progress management. The main task is to communicate with clients and production staff. A director at Vage may also include the duties of a consultant or UX researcher, or a designer or engineer may also serve as a director. In this way, the duties of a director will vary depending on the individual's desires and aptitudes as well as the size and characteristics of the project. In any case, a director at Baisi is not a "do-it-yourselfer who manages the progress of a project," but rather an important post that handles the communication aspects related to marketing and creativity.
##### Main Responsibilities : Imanishi, Odate, Gonoi, Furunaga

#### **Designer**
&nbsp;
###### The definition of "designer" is currently expanding to include areas such as service planning and UX research, but the main role of a designer at Vage is to create UI designs using Adobe XD and Photoshop. At Vage, wireframes, which used to be the domain of information architects and directors, are now the domain of designers. Therefore, designers are required to have an upstream understanding of strategy and logical design skills, and there are many opportunities to work on and support some of the proposals in the marketing and UX domains. When it comes to development, designers are also responsible for directing motion design and checking and supporting engineers in terms of usability. Although designers at Baisi work with their hands to create visual elements, they are not only responsible for visuals, but also cover a wide range of positions that are related to solving essential issues.
##### Main Responsibilities : Nigiya, Kim, Seikyu, Takatsuka, Ikeda, Tsukamoto, Takashima, Shinyashiki

#### **copywriter**
&nbsp;
###### We believe that copy is a very important element in providing user and customer experiences, and the copy required for website content and the microcopy know-how required for UI design are different from traditional advertising copy and require a thorough understanding of the web and UI. For this reason, at Bage, copy is handled by directors and designers who excel in copy. Since there are few members who have specialized training in copywriting, we hold in-house study sessions to improve our copywriting skills. In addition, we are also making efforts to strengthen our copy and content skills by operating our own daily report website.
##### Main Responsibilities : Nukiya, Gonoi, Koga

#### **engineer**
&nbsp;
###### At Baisi, we do not distinguish between front-end engineers and server-side engineers, but rather refer to all of our staff as "engineers. This is based on the idea that there is no front-end or server-side implementation technology, and that all languages should be handled in a flat manner. In the early stages of development, we mainly implement HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and after the middle stage of development, we tend to handle WordPress and PHP. We also take the lead in documentation related to development and testing just before delivery and publication. There are directors and designers in the company, so there is relatively a lot of communication with non-engineers, and there is a monthly study session on JavaScript with assignments by an external lecturer, as well as several other study sessions, where information is actively exchanged within the company. There are several other study sessions, and information is actively exchanged within the company.
##### Main contact person : Nomura, Nagata, Sakai, Inoi, Nishimura, Urasaki, Kim, Hak-Gwan
&nbsp;

#### **Occupations that do not exist in the Vage**
&nbsp;
###### At Vage, we aim to organize our team more efficiently. For this reason, we do not have the following positions within the company, but rather collaborate with outside experts when necessary.
&nbsp;
* Sales Representative      
  
* Public Relations      

* Human Resources      

* photographer      

* translation
