### Message from the President

**Exciting and curious technology is what will boost your performance.**

{{< imagedisplay  src="スライド28.PNG"  >}}

Thank you for visiting this website.  
What is important to us is how to make your work exciting and enjoyable. To help you immerse yourself in the development process, we have incorporated the latest technologies such as the following. For example, we have dramatically improved the accuracy of machine learning, dramatically increased the speed of data search, and realized fast screen transitions. "Oh! Amazing!" You will be able to experience manufacturing that will arouse your curiosity.

**AutoML**  
An AI development tool that can automate the machine learning process of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and predicting data. It enables you to predict future events with high accuracy based on a vast amount of information such as images and customer data.

**Cosmos**  
The latest technology that drastically reduces the waiting time when searching for the desired information in a huge database. By storing data in the form of a tree and distributing it all over the world, it is possible to manipulate data close to the user.

**Blazor**     
A framework where new information arrives one after another, and the latest information is always displayed on the screen. It eliminates the need to "click the refresh button" and automatically switches content without reloading a single web page.  
You do not need to be familiar with these technologies from the start. Those who have never handled big data are also welcome. In the process of developing software through trial and error, we believe that the accumulation of "excitement" and "excitement" at the moment when things work as expected will lead to results. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I am able to do something I could not do before. And the sense of anticipation that comes with the completion of a product, such as "I think I can do this" or "I think this can be applied to that. When the product is completed, I feel a sense of anticipation. If you come up with new ideas during the development process, please let us know.

#### Manufacturing that will have an impact on the world is waiting for you.

Planning and efficiency are secondary.  
Value the impact of your goals and products  
A place where we can enjoy "discovery" as we continue to correct our course.  
You can enjoy the fun in the tough.  
Highly flexible engineering  
Would you like to be a part of the driving force behind such innovation?

#### Seeking explorers who want to blaze new trails.

An unexplored region that no one has ever visited, an area where no routes have been made.  
Stepping into uncharted territory and discovering that there are continents and resources.  
We cut trees, watered them, planted seedlings, and asked ourselves, "Can we do this?" "If method A doesn't work, what about method B?"  
Through repeated trial and error, more houses were built, a village was established, and eventually it became a town where people gathered.

Andaze is looking for people who are excited by the word "pioneering" and who want to create a "new genre" from scratch where engineering can enter the corporate business scene.

#### Working in a way that allows room and latitude is directly related to results.

We believe that in order to create innovation, we need to work in a way that is not bound by time or place. On the other hand, the term "black company," which became the buzzword of the year in 2013, was rooted in the old value system that "employees are supposed to slack off. With this way of thinking.  

<div class="table-width">

|**Company side**|**Employee side**|
|---|---|
|Difficulty in making bold demands due to the guilt of low wages|Low requirements prevent you from realizing your full potential.|
|Thoroughly manage time by submitting daily reports, etc.|Yes-men who don't produce results are valued.|
|Evaluate by workload, not by results.|I don't have a good relationship with the company.|
| |Realizing that you were a "frog in a well" at your next new job.|
| |I'm so bogged down in miscellaneous tasks that I can't concentrate on the work I should be doing.|

</div>

There are many disadvantages in exchange for low wages. There will be few situations where we can feel the sense of accomplishment and fun that we value.  
At Andaze, to put it another way, whether you work today or take the day off is irrelevant to your evaluation. We are fully remote, fully flexible, and do not manage time. On the other hand, based on our extensive know-how of performance management, we evaluate people regardless of their working hours. In other words, just sitting at your desk is not enough to be evaluated. In addition, since we are involved in system development that is a pioneer for IT companies in Japan, we will be required to work at a very high level. Because of this, the speed of growth is obvious. It can be said that the technical skills you will acquire in just two to three years will be the envy of the industry.

#### For you, who have not been dyed in any color.
What kind of people are the engineers working at our company? Many of them have not been exposed to the latest technology until they joined our company. It's not that they are sensitive to the latest trends and information in the city. There are young people who were crazy about programming in their hometowns, students who were hesitant to move to the city because they wanted to take care of their families, and young men who are not good at talking to people but love technology.  
Their eyes shine brightly and they absorb new knowledge and skills in no time at all. So you don't have to stretch yourself and act like a smart engineer. Why don't you knock on the door of Andaze with a life-size figure?

Next, we would like to deliver a message from our representative and senior staff to those who are considering applying. Please take a look at the real voices of our members who are actually working in the field.
