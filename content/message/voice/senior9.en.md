##### **`This is who I am.`**

###### I have been a heavy metal fan since I was a student, listening only to Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne, but when I joined Bajie, a group of various music lovers, I started listening to fashionable music that I never listened to before. However, I prefer heavy metal music where everyone can shake their heads and sing loudly together. I can't stop playing live even if I lose my glasses, get yelled at and scared, or get a backache. I also enjoy breeding killifish by creating a small biotope like a bonsai tree. I'm trying to figure out how to make the killifish swim comfortably from their point of view. What kind of driftwood should I use? What kind of driftwood would be best?

##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### At Baisi, almost everything related to website production is done in-house, so you can be involved in the development process while closely watching the website being completed. Even as an engineer, I can give my opinion on the design and exchange information with other staff members, and communication is very active. Most of the work we do is related to the entire website, not just a few small functions, so there is a great sense of accomplishment when the website is released. The company has a policy of actively implementing new technologies, so once you join us, you will be encouraged to propose what you want to do.
