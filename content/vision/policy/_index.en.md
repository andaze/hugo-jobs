### **Our Training Policy**
&nbsp;
###### What we want to develop is not just people who create websites, but people who can continue to be active in the future. To achieve this, we conduct our daily training with the following in mind.

#### **Two conditions for developing people who are resistant to change**
&nbsp;
###### In order to continuously develop people who are resilient to change, we must devise ways of doing our daily work itself, and I believe that two things in particular should be kept in mind.
###### One of the first things to do is not to fix your skills too much. It will be easier to improve if you focus on a specific field of work. In the beginning, this may be a good idea. But if you keep doing the same job all the time, you will become accustomed to working in your comfort zone, your work will become routine, and you will lose your ability to apply yourself. And when the market and value changes, you are stuck.
###### In order to avoid this, I think it is desirable to work in a way that allows you to be exposed to peripheral areas from time to time, while maintaining an axis of your specialty. For example, an engineer may be involved in design and analysis, or a designer may be involved in direction, and so on. At Baisi, we often do this kind of "small job rotation" to provide opportunities to experience work that is not part of your original job title.
###### The other is to "find universal skills in daily work. Universal skills, also known as soft skills or portable skills, are skills that are needed regardless of the type of job, such as logical thinking, problem solving, marketing, communication, writing, and leadership. These are skills that can be acquired in any job, not just web development. However, on the other hand, they are also difficult to acquire if you are not aware of them, no matter what kind of work you do.
###### At Baisi, we provide opportunities to reflect on the day's work through our action guidelines and daily report system, and we also communicate what universal skills are involved when we request work. In this way, we are devising ways of working so that employees can be aware of universal skills on a daily basis.

#### **10 Universal Skills You Can Acquire at Vage**
&nbsp;
###### While there are a wide variety of universal skills, at BAYJ, we place particular emphasis on the following skills, and have created an organization and structure to help people acquire them in the course of their work.

##### **1&nbsp; Logical Thinking**
###### The ability to think logically. It is the ability to present a reasonable rationale and derive the best solution from fragmented information. Many events are cumulative patterns, and people are more persuaded by logic that makes sense. Therefore, logical thinking increases the probability of success in any job. It is also a core skill in the field of vage, where we evaluate quality with logic and develop the habit of thinking with logic in our work.
&nbsp;

##### **2&nbsp; critical thinking**
###### The ability to think critically. It is the ability to think from a zero-based perspective and deepen one's thinking without being carried away by assumptions. Criticism is often seen as a bad thing, but constructive criticism leads to healthy growth and improvement. Critical thinking generates quality problem-posing and ideas in any work. In the Bage, we will also train critical thinking by encouraging students to think for themselves without providing easy answers.
&nbsp;

##### **3&nbsp; verbalizing ability**
###### It is the ability to express oneself with words. It is the ability to convey ideas and move people with well-organized words. In today's text communication-centered world, the ability to verbalize is a powerful weapon. People who have a good command of language are able to exert influence in all kinds of work. At Vage, there are plenty of opportunities to develop your verbalization skills through daily reports, documentation, and other work activities.
&nbsp;

##### **4&nbsp; metacognitive ability**
###### It is the ability to see oneself objectively. It is the ability to look at a situation from a bird's eye view and make calm judgments without being swayed by subjective preferences or emotions. It is a central skill in UX work to be attentive to the feelings of others, and is directly related to logical thinking and critical thinking. At Bage, we train metacognitive skills in daily work through feedback from others and self-reflection through daily reports.
&nbsp;

##### **5&nbsp; Negotiation and presentation skills**
###### It is the ability to communicate opinions and move people. Conflicts of opinion are not uncommon in business. If you have the ability to negotiate and make presentations, you can create an advantageous situation, even if the other party is difficult. At Baisi, we try to create as many opportunities as possible for designers and engineers to negotiate and make presentations, taking advantage of the fact that we work directly with our clients and not through an agency.
&nbsp;

##### **6&nbsp; The power to build a reputation**
###### It is the power to create a reputation. It creates a personal brand inside and outside the company. It is said that reputation is the most important intangible asset to survive in the 100th era of life. Reputation leads to the next job and creates an advantageous situation in a new environment. At Baisi, we actively promote the names of our employees through daily reports and other sites, encourage social networking, and teach blogging and social networking skills to those who wish to use them.
&nbsp;

##### **7&nbsp; Marketing**
###### It is the ability to understand the market and customers structurally, and to devise and implement effective measures. It is the foundation of management and business. There is no industry or occupation where marketing cannot be utilized, and it is the most powerful business skill. It is one of the strengths of Baisi, and we train it every day by proposing strategies to a wide variety of companies. We also allow designers and engineers to be involved, and we actively share information within the company.
&nbsp;
##### **8&nbsp; Leadership**
###### It is the ability to lead others. They take the initiative and try to solve the problem. People trust leaders the most when they talk about them. Being a leader is the best way to enjoy your work. At Baisi, we have devised a way of assigning tasks, including small internal projects, so that everyone can experience being a leader. This is clearly stated in our action guidelines and evaluation indicators, and we have created a culture that highly values leadership.
&nbsp;

##### **9&nbsp; Productivity ideas**
###### It is the ability to always think in terms of productivity. We are aware of bottlenecks and how to work in the most productive way possible. There is no job that encourages inefficiency. People who can work with efficiency in mind will be the best people to work with in any industry. At Vage, we have created an environment where you can learn how to work in a highly productive manner through project visualization and precise task management.
&nbsp;

##### **10&nbsp; organization**
###### It is the power of organization. If you are trying to solve the essence of a problem, it is essential to work on the organization. The experience of building an organization is an experience that can be applied to any job. At Vage, we try to verbalize and communicate the intentions of the top management so that everyone can participate in the organization building process. We also share failures as much as possible so that everyone can experience the trial and error of the organization.
