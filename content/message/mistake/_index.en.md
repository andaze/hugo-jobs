### Andaz's three "automations"
**So that you can focus on higher-value work.**    
Anders is working to "automate" manufacturing processes, testing, and other time-consuming and costly tasks. By incorporating automation, we can increase efficiency and improve productivity and product quality.

#### Automating the software manufacturing process
We are using BizDevOps, a method to increase the speed of development while improving accuracy.
- **Management team (mainly clients) creating blueprints for products**
- **Operations team (mainly the client) to determine if the system is as expected.**
- **Development team (mainly ours) that creates software based on needs**   
and refers to a system in which three teams that transcend departmental and company boundaries work closely together to achieve the same goal.     
If you don't have BizDevOps, when building a large system, development may proceed without sharing the production environment. This makes it easy for problems to occur after completion, such as differences from expectations or difficulty in use, and high quality cannot be expected. In addition, there will be a loss of time, such as having to work overtime to deal with the problem. In addition, the management ledger created in excel is like an encyclopedia, and it is difficult to search for each item one by one. This makes the system vulnerable to changes in the middle of the process, and the only purpose is to build the system.    
BizDevOps, on the other hand, is a style that can be checked for each small system and frequently runs through the operational cycle with three teams. With just a click on the tool, we can view necessary information such as who is doing what by when, where the project is currently stopped, and the record of answering inquiries from clients. In addition, the accuracy of the development process is greatly improved, as the details of the functions are worked out through information coordination between departments while having the prototypes checked. This can be expected to shorten the delivery time before release and improve productivity. As a result of this automation of the software manufacturing process, we are able to work with minimal effort to create great value.

#### Test Automation
The quality of software greatly affects the trust of a company. For example, just one wrong line in a program might cause a data center to shut down or an information leak to occur. Even if the system is complex and large, the client requires speed of development and reliable quality.    
In order to minimize the risk, developers have to "check" the application every time it is completed, find errors, and fix them until it is perfect. Depending on the product, this may require hundreds of thousands of tests to be completed. If this is done by hand, not only will it take an inordinate amount of time and cost, but there is also the possibility of human error. No matter how much we say, "Please test to be absolutely sure," humans have their limitations.      
Therefore, we utilize a test support tool to automatically run tests every time an application is completed. The robot operates 24 hours a day to accurately handle the huge number of test items without worrying about labor costs or the burden on workers. The greater the number of tests, the earlier problems can be detected without omissions, and product upgrades can be completed in a shorter period of time. In the meantime, engineers can concentrate on other development and work, which also helps to increase their motivation. This not only speeds up development, but also improves the overall quality of the project.

#### Use of machine translation functions
There are opportunities to communicate in English in the office, but by no means is it important to be able to "speak English. Language barriers can be solved by AI and automatic translation functions. For example, in a web conference where many languages are spoken, you can use the "translation service" provided by Microsoft. Your words will be displayed on the screen in the listener's official language in almost real time, so you can have a question and answer session in multiple languages without any problems. Don't worry, you don't have to hesitate to apply just because you are not confident in your English or Japanese.

Now that you have an idea of what it's like to work at Andaz, let's take a look at the Hanzomon area and the surrounding area. Next, we'll take a look at the Hanzomon area where the office is located and the surrounding information.
