### Introduction

### Bage Features
  In recent years, the attention on Bage has rapidly increased, and we have received many requests for lectures and interviews. I believe that the reason why we are attracting so much attention in the industry despite being a small web production company is because we are continuing to study the three areas necessary for the web.

  ####  <a id="sectionBlock1"></a>Our Strengths in Business 
  Isn't it obvious that a company involved in production should be good at marketing, design, and management? You might think so. However, many companies have their strengths and weaknesses in these areas, and the characteristics of their business have a great impact on the way they work. This section will explain the differences in detail.

##### Marketing skills to understand the business structurally and get to the root of the problem
  In the strategy phase, we use a number of frameworks and repeat research and analysis over a period of about two months, and the total number of documents we create during this period exceeds one sheet. These solid strategic proposals are the source of our equal relationship with our clients. This knowledge is also utilized in the management of the company, and in 2006 we received more than 400 inquiries per year. It is rare to find a web production company in Japan that has such a successful website. Working at Baisi, you will experience a marketing culture that is unique for a web production company.

##### Highest level of design capability in Japan
  The reason we incorporate marketing and UX design approaches into our web development is to pursue the essence of design, which is problem solving, but we also consider creative elements such as copy, photography, visuals, and engineering as very important design elements. I also consider creative elements such as copy, photography, visuals, and engineering as very important elements of design. In this way, we believe that everything from the concept to the styling and engineering details are necessary for "high quality design," and we have established a system that allows us to be consistent within the company.

##### Management skills to ensure smooth project progress
  In 2018, we created a workflow that is broken down into about 140 tasks based on the know-how we have cultivated in our work. In 2018, we created a workflow broken down into about 140 tasks based on the know-how we have accumulated through our work. Each task has a defined job function and documentation, which enables highly productive project progress without dependency. Also essential for stable management is the integration of shared values, customer selection, and recruitment strategies. We have developed a unique management model based on our behavioral guidelines and an organizational design that allows business elements to work closely and interact with each other.
#### <a id="sectionBlock2"></a>Differences from other companies in the industry
  Isn't it obvious that a company involved in production should be good at marketing, design, and management? You might think so. However, many companies have their strengths and weaknesses in these areas, and the characteristics of their business have a great impact on the way they work. This section will explain the differences in detail.
##### General web development company
  While they are good at design and development, they tend to be bad at marketing and management. They tend to have an individualistic work style, and there is a tendency to work in an ad hoc manner. This is a great environment to acquire skills in a short period of time, but they are weak in business and cannot break free from the position of a production company, which tends to lead to a slavish relationship with clients and an exhausting workplace. In order to determine whether the work environment is healthy, it is necessary to check the percentage of direct business dealings and the specific management methods.
##### General Advertising Agencies
  The main business is to handle all aspects of advertising, not specializing in the web, and in many cases, production is outsourced to outside subcontractors. In many cases, production is subcontracted to outside companies. There are also companies that emphasize customer relations rather than rational decision making, as business practices before the Internet remain strong. In general, this is not a good place for designers and engineers to work, but there are cases where there are in-house production teams that focus on operations. In that case, you will need to check what they do as actual operations.
##### General web marketing/consulting company
  Basically, I am good at planning marketing strategies using the web. While they are strong at proposing strategies and conducting research, they are not very good at web design and implementation, and do not have much ability to make plans come to fruition. Also, if they specialize in operational advertising, SEO, or specific solutions, they may focus on selling their methods and only do certain limited areas of marketing. This is not a good place for designers and engineers to work, but it is a good option for consultants and directors.
##### In the case of Bage
  As a business form, we are both a web production company with strong design skills and a web marketing company with strong marketing skills. Unlike advertising agencies, we insist on consistent internal production, so we have all the knowledge necessary for web production in-house, and we have a management system in place that allows us to consistently handle everything from strategy to delivery. With these strengths, we are able to avoid unreasonable deadlines and create a healthy work environment by seeking an equal relationship with our clients.
##### <a id="sectionBlock3"></a> Differences from Business Companies
  In recent years, the comparison between operating companies and contract companies is often discussed as a place for designers, engineers, and marketers to work. So here is an explanation of the difference in working style between a typical business company and a baiji.
##### General business company
  A generic term for companies that operate their own business. There is a wide range of industries, business types, and sizes, but the clients are internal, deadlines are loose, and work can be done in a relatively relaxed manner. One of the advantages of working for a business company is the close proximity to the business side. However, there are many times when you are continuously involved in a single business, and if you work for a business company when you are inexperienced, you may not be able to acquire a wide range of skills. In addition, since design and web production are not the main business for a business company, there is no established reputation, and changes in the business environment may lead to organizational downsizing or reassignment.
##### General Trustee Company
 We are a general web production company, design company, and system development company. The client is an external company. In addition to specialized knowledge, the ability to build relationships with clients is also important, and working for a company that cannot choose its clients tends to be exhausting. The work is limited to specific fields such as design and systems, and there are few opportunities to get involved in the upstream. On the other hand, you can gain a wealth of experience in specialized areas such as design and systems. They also have a culture rooted in design and systems, and are familiar with education. Since production and development are the main focus of the business, it is unlikely that you will suddenly change your job title.
##### In the case of Bage
  Since we are a web production company, we naturally have the strong nature of a contracting company. However, we minimize the problems that contract companies tend to have by strengthening our marketing capabilities to increase inquiries and select customers, taking a consultative and proposal-based stance to take the initiative, and developing management to prevent confusion in projects. There are also many opportunities to learn about business as you are deeply involved with clients and can propose strategies to management. Career paths from designers and engineers also exist within the company.
