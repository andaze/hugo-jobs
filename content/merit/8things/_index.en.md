<!--### Introduction-->
### Eight things you can get from a vage
What we focus on the most in our recruitment strategy is the "meaning of working at Vage. Without it, there would be no reason to choose or continue working at Vage. This is far more important than the kind of person we are looking for. I have summarized the eight main reasons for working here.
 [1. Acquire universal skills that will be useful in the age of 100 years of life](#sectionBlock1) 
 [2.Zero subcontractors, so we can control the work.](#sectionBlock2)
 [3. I have reliable friends I can talk to immediately.](#sectionBlock3)

 #### <a id="sectionBlock1"></a>1.Acquire universal skills that will be useful in the age of 100 years of life
 In our company, we work not only on how to create websites, but also on logical thinking, critical thinking, communication, marketing, leadership, and other universal skills that are needed for any job. In this age of 100 years of life, we will not be able to finish our lives in one job. The greatest significance of working for a company is to acquire skills that can be applied to any job, whether it is running a café or farming. We aim to be a company where people can say, "What I learned was useful," no matter what job they take。
#### 2. <a id="sectionBlock2"></a>Zero subcontractors, so we can control the work.
Most of our projects are prime contractors, and none of our work is done through advertising agencies. We are in a position to make proposals directly to clients and negotiate deadlines and schedules. There is no such thing as being pushed around by an agency director with poor skills. Of course, because we are dealing directly with the customer, there are some harshnesses that we cannot make excuses for. Of course, there is no excuse for the rigors of dealing directly with clients, but this is part of the reason why we are able to do work that is rewarding as our own achievements.

#### 3. <a id="sectionBlock3"></a>I have reliable friends I can talk to immediately.
We have all the necessary skills for web production, from strategy, planning, design, and system development, and we have a system in place that allows us to complete the work in-house. Our work is basically divided up, but we communicate closely, and if there is something we don't understand in an adjacent area, someone will always follow up with us. There is no need to waste time worrying about things that are not your specialty.

#### <a id="sectionBlock4"></a>4.You can feel your influence.
We are a small company of less than 20 people. This allows the company to pay attention to each individual. If you have any requests, you can immediately let the company know, and if necessary, the rules and systems can be changed quickly. The representative is also close by in the same office, so you can talk to him or her immediately and ask for advice. This is an environment where you can enjoy the advantages of a company with a small number of people. You will strongly feel that you have influence over the company and that you are needed by the organization.
#### <a id="sectionBlock5"></a>5.Various career paths are available.
Since we provide integrated services from strategy to operational support, you can try out a variety of jobs, not just one. It is possible to start as a designer or engineer and then take charge of UX or marketing. In addition, the company will continue to increase its number of employees and plans to expand to a scale of about 30 people. We are still looking for members who can play a central role. You can work with us to change and build up the organization. You can get a position that is difficult to get in a company that is already established.
#### <a id="sectionBlock6"></a>6.Company's understanding of manufacturing
The representative of the company himself is an active designer. As a manager, I understand the importance of business, sales, and profits, but more than that, I believe that creating good products and doing good work support the foundation of the company. For this reason, we are negative about imposing sales quotas on designers and engineers, or initiating short-circuiting activities that undermine their creative spirit. If designers and engineers want a new environment, they will positively consider introducing it, even if the return on investment is a little unclear. Being able to work under a management team and supervisors who understand the feelings of people who create things is an important factor for creators.
#### <a id="sectionBlock7"></a>7.Actively supporting activities outside the company.
In this age of individuality, we don't want our employees to be confined within the company and lose their connection with the outside world. This is why we operate a daily report website and actively publicize the names of our employees. As a company with a certain level of name recognition in the industry, we receive many requests for speaking and writing engagements. As a company, we actively support the use of such opportunities to expose ourselves to the outside world. We also encourage participation in seminars and events, and cooperate with schedule adjustments. Second jobs are allowed, and there is no need to work five hours a week. As long as it does not interfere with your main job, you can work freely while being involved with outside parties.
#### 8.<a id="sectionBlock8"></a>Ability to work in a good working relationship
Although there is a strict aspect to the work, the company is full of calm people. We don't have factions, people who don't get along with each other, or troublemakers. The reason for this is that at Vage, we hire for culture fit rather than skills. If you are hired by us, it means that you will fit in well with our culture. We take great care to create an environment where you can devote yourself to your work without being bothered by unnecessary human relationships.

These benefits are equally available to all employees, regardless of their work history or position. In the following pages, we will introduce you to some of the different types of jobs that exist within BAYJ.
