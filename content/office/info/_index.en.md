### **Delicious restaurants in Shimokitazawa**
&nbsp;
###### Shimokitazawa, where our office is located, is a very attractive town with many unique stores that you can't find anywhere else. Here are some of the restaurants recommended by our employees that can be used mainly for weekday lunches and evening drinks. (In alphabetical order)

#### **As Shimokitazawa (Korean food / 3 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Dent Building 1F, 2-23-12 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/jTdw6nggGzL2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a rare Korean restaurant in Shimokitazawa. During the daytime on weekdays, there are not only women, but also male office workers. The background music in the restaurant is of course K-POP, and there are also Korean cosmetics and magazines. The atmosphere is nice and the food tastes good. It is close to my office, and I recommend it to people who like spicy food and Korea. (Ikeda)

#### **one dragon (ramen/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`30-11, Kitazawa 2-chome, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/EmbtbedWNc12){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a counter restaurant that is easy to enter by yourself. The combination of the crunchy texture of the bamboo shoots and the tasty pork and chicken soup is the best. We also recommend the cold Chinese tsukemen, which is only available for a limited time in summer. (long field)

#### **Nitori Shimokitazawa, Gyujin (and food/1 point for walking)**
##### [***`Tsubasa Mansion 1F, 2-1-1 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/LiD7JFfPUQt){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### Uoshin is a popular fish restaurant in Shimokitazawa, and its annex was recently opened near my office. It's close, clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Personally, I love the grilled nodo tuna at this restaurant. It seems to be open only at night, but I'm sure I'll be using this restaurant from time to time. (Nuke Valley)



#### **Cafe Vietto Arco (cafe/2 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Montblanc Building 2F, 2-26-6 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/21NwGinWHcy){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a cafe that I used to frequent since my office was located in another part of Shimokitazawa. At that time, I used it for interviews and meetings. I used to use the caf√© for meetings and interviews because it was spacious, not too crowded, and the seats next to each other were free, making it very comfortable. They also serve lunch and dinner, and their Vietnamese based dishes are delicious. (Nuke Valley)


#### **CAFE okidokei (cafe/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Kazama Building 2FA, 2-25-13, Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/Yc7wdoGB6FE2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a cafe that I often use during my lunch break or after work. There are soft sofas, and on days when you can sit down, you can have a relaxing time as if time has stopped just here. The food is delicious, but the homemade chai with slightly spicy spices is addictive. (long field)

#### **Planet of Curry (curry/3 minutes walk)**
##### [***`3-34-3 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/S6iZSFfh3Wu){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### Along with Hannya, this is one of my two favorite curry restaurants in Shimokitazawa. The restaurant is produced by Mr. Seiki Fukuya, the owner of Shimokitazawa Aged Room, a long-established bistro in Shimokitazawa. After changing the style several times, I settled on the current menu. The curry is made by a full-fledged chef, and the exquisite mix of spices is simply irresistible. The dishes and the appearance are also beautiful. (Nuke Valley)

#### **Former Yam Residence, Simokita-so (curry/10 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Nice Building, 5-29-9 Daizawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/Vjmgpzm5YW72){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### Since opening in 2017, this spicy curry restaurant has now (personally) become one of the top contenders in Shimokita. I have a selfish sense of familiarity with this store, as it is originally from Kansai. (long field)

#### **King of Gyoza (ramen/10 minutes walk)**
##### [***`5-36-16 Daizawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/28W3KGDgYmv){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### Gyoza no Ohsho, a favorite among boys, is also located in Shimokitazawa. It's a little far from my office, but when I want to eat gyoza, I go here. The lunch menu at the Shimokitazawa branch, "Nira Reba Lunch," is a set of Nira Reba stir-fry and gyoza, and is a good choice if you are feeling tired.(this world)
###### One lunch experience you can't go wrong with is at Ousho. It's a bit of a walk from the office, but it's also a nice change of pace. When the air is dry, you can have a bowl of Wang Shou Ramen (soy sauce and pork bones) and just the right size of stir-fried leek liver; when you want a hearty bowl of noodles but don't want soup, but don't feel like tsukemen, you can have a bowl of yakisoba (soy sauce). If you are in the mood for something fierce, you can go for the fried rice with salt sauce or the fried chicken with oil. After you've eaten a lot of food, you can leave the restaurant and take a detour to the right to the Disk Union before returning to the office to burn off some calories and have a perfect lunch break. (Inui.)

#### **Couscous Rougere (bistro/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Uwa Heights Kitazawa 1F, 3-21-5 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/dePXzS1MRr72){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This restaurant specializes in couscous, which is rare in Japan. The base of couscous is not African cuisine, but French. Couscous is so delicious! But the couscous is also excellent. My personal favorites are the buttery shrimp bread and the melt-in-your-mouth roast beef. According to the food log, it is the No.1 restaurant in Shimokitazawa!(As of October 2018). (Nuke Valley)

#### **Kumamoto Farm Directly Managed by Harada Shoten (Kumamoto Cuisine/3 minutes walk)**
##### [***`1F Sumire Building, 2-23-6 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/bBsbV5QNABF2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a Kumamoto/Kyushu restaurant that can be reached in less than a minute on foot from the west exit. You can enjoy authentic horse sashimi as the main dish at a reasonable price, as well as motsunabe and jidori chicken dishes. The menu also has a variety of daily specials, and depending on the season, you may even be able to try live shrimp. The restaurant is not that spacious, but it is very comfortable. (Takatsuka)

#### **Kurokawa Restaurant (set meal/7 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Yellow Box 2F, 2-14-6 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/korZUptHSVF2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### The all-you-can-eat salad and fruit bar is highly recommended. They purchase fresh vegetables and other items from a directly managed farmer, so they are extremely fresh. Even if you live alone, you can go here and get many kinds of nutrition at a reasonable price. The set menu has a wide variety of dishes, so you won't get bored no matter how many times you visit. (Ikeda)

#### **mulberry plantation (ramen/1 minute walk)**
##### [***`3-26, Chiyoda 6-chome, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/s9ZisiTmukQ2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### The chicken bone salt ramen, which is as thick as a potage soup, is a must-try dish for visitors to Shimokitazawa. The chicken chashu (pork chashu) is cooked at a low temperature to make it rare, and is usually topped with wasabi (free of charge), which can be ordered with the ramen. It is a small restaurant with only 10 seats at the counter, but in the past few years it has become so popular that a small line forms at night. (coarse sand)

#### **kebab Chef (Turkish food/7 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Honey Shimokitazawa Building 2F, 2-14-14 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/Pb7FFhd4r5F2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### When you think of Turkish food, you probably think of kebabs with a junk food feel that are sold at street stalls. However, the food at this restaurant is different. Lunch is in the 1000 yen range, and the Adana Kebab Set (beef and lamb tsukune sticks) is highly recommended. Not only the meat, but also the vegetable dishes such as the set salad and the roasted whole peppers for garnish are not to be underestimated. (large mansion)

#### **coffee made with a small piece of coffee (cafe/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Green Terrace Building 1F, 2-33-6 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/BStDWLo2SB42){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a coffee specialty store where you can buy coffee from the beans, but you can also taste it in the store. It's a specialty coffee shop, and the coffee is delicious. The interior is not particularly elaborate or spacious, but it is a place that makes you feel relaxed and comfortable, and you will want to stop by after lunch. (Nuke Valley)

#### **jungle horn (set meal/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`2-8-12 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/7iVWFteEEnH2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### The restaurant is located in the back of Ichiban-gai, so it may seem a bit far from the office, but you can get a good set meal for less than 1000 yen. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very cozy, just like a traditional teishoku-ya. The most popular item is the braised beef tendon set meal, which is priced the same, but somehow the portions are larger or smaller depending on the day. I recommend this restaurant to those who want to eat orthodox set meals. (sake well)

#### **Szechuan Cuisine Tian Hua (Chinese/3 minutes walk)**
##### [***`West Front 1F, 2-23-10 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/7V27vdpwWf12){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### It is expensive at night, but for lunch they have several reasonable lunches in the 1000 yen range. Their mapo doufu (bean curd soup) is excellent, and I go there at least twice a month. Sichuan cuisine tends to conjure up images of spicy food, but when you order, you can choose whether or not to use Chinese pepper. You can also adjust the amount, and I personally recommend "less" as I feel it brings out the flavor the most. (sake well)
###### I recommend the mapo tofu. There are two types of mapo doufu, the original Japanese mapo doufu and the authentic Szechuan Chen mapo doufu, but I recommend the Szechuan style. The pungent aroma of sansho (Japanese pepper) is irresistible. However, those who do not like spicy food may need to be careful. (large mansion)

#### **Shimokita Gravy Gyoza (Dumplings, Chinese food/7 minutes walk)**
##### [***`30-2, Kitazawa 3-chome, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/dGFshdxdxwA2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### I often go there with my colleagues after work. The main dish is gyoza, but no matter what you order, you will not be disappointed and everything is delicious. The price is cheap; you can satisfy yourself with about 2,500 yen. Personally, I recommend the hot and spicy sauce dumplings and the red hot and spicy noodles. (long field)

#### **Shimokitazawa Maturity Room (bistro/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`2F Iijima Building, 2-33-6 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/QizYBcGUueQ2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This restaurant is one of the most popular bistros in Shimokitazawa. This is the first restaurant produced by Mr. Seiki Fukuya, and it has been loved for a long time in Shimokitazawa, so there is no doubt about its taste. You can enjoy delicious aged meat and wine. The lunch with lots of vegetables is also recommended, but unfortunately it is only available on weekends, so you cannot enjoy it on weekdays. (Nuke Valley)

#### **Pure handmade noodles and future (ramen/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`3-25-1 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/S6BiBHg7Fh32){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a new ramen shop that opened in 2018, but the lines are quickly forming. The soup is made of Japanese dashi (soup stock) and is clear and refreshing, but unlike its appearance, it has a great flavor. Even more impressive are the ultra-thick noodles, which look like udon noodles, but the slightly bumpy, glutinous noodles are great with the soup. The shrimp wontons are also delicious. The ochazuke at the end of the meal is also delicious. (Nuke Valley)

#### **Starbucks Coffee Shimokitazawa (cafe/3 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Shimokitazawa UC Building 1F-B1, 2-30-6 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/kzv2Qz1wJ112){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### Starbucks is also located near our office, so Starbucks fans are encouraged to take advantage of it. The seating capacity is decent, but even during the daytime on weekdays, there are rather a lot of students and housewives, and I have the impression that the seats are always occupied, so I often use takeout. (Nuke Valley)

#### **Steak no kuishinbo Shimokitazawa (steak/10 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Kumazaki No.1 Building 1F, 2-1-9 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/iEXS71uwAhK2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a restaurant where you can get a set of steak, rice, salad, and soup for 1,000 to 1,500 yen. Not only is the steak delicious, but the rice is free to refill, so you can't help but overeat. As the name suggests, it is recommended for those who are kuishinbo. (long field)

#### **Soba and Chicken Hansamu (soba/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`MT Building 102, 3-25-1 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/DDBPw4K3ngM2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a restaurant that serves Nihachi Soba, a type of buckwheat noodle that is close to 100 percent buckwheat. The noodles are slightly powdery and you can taste the hand-made texture. For lunch, they offer a set of soba and either tendon or oyakodon. A set of delicious soba noodles and a bowl of rice topped with tendon tends to be expensive, but here you can have it for a reasonable price of 1,000 yen. Also, it is very close to Kohaze Coffee, so you can easily go for a cup of coffee after dinner. (sake well)

#### **tunnel restaurant (set meal/ÂæíÊ≠©3ÂàÜ)**
##### [***`6-12-36 Chiyoda, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/955iiteeLHL2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### There is one main dish per day, and in addition to that, you can choose from a variety of side dishes to create your own set meal. The main dish changes daily, with a wide variety of meat and fish, so you won't get bored even if you go every day. With only a counter in the restaurant, it is recommended for those who want to have a quick and healthy meal rather than enjoying a leisurely meal. Take-out is also available. (coarse sand)

#### **old man with no balls (curry/10 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Alpha Building 1F, 5-36-8 Daizawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/SWLffDWfgoP2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### It is a curry shop with a stylish caf√©-like appearance, located in a back alley near the three-way intersection down the south exit shopping street. It was established in 1990 and the second generation has inherited the taste of the previous generation. The curry is characterized by its spicy yet sweet taste, and the large cuts of meat and vegetables are filling and filling. The restaurant is equipped with a turntable and JBL speakers, where you can spend a relaxing time while listening to records. (this world)

#### **Meat Juice Dumpling Factory Dandadan Tavern (gyoza/4 minutes walk)**
##### [***`2-10-10 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/q1LRVAzRi2H2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a dumpling restaurant with a distinctive signboard with strong letters written on it. As the name implies, the restaurant serves hot and juicy gyoza. The restaurant is also open for lunch, and is recommended for those who want to eat gyoza with gusto during the day. (Takatsuka)

#### **Barr Alimentari Daniela (Italian/10 minutes walk)**
##### [***`1F, 5-16-23, Daizawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/p98dvF5bcfK2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### It's a bit of a walk from my office, so not many people go there for lunch, but I personally like the restaurant. It is an Italian restaurant, but the pasta is fresh pasta. The pasta is Italian, but the pasta is made with fresh pasta, which is very tasty with its unique flavor and texture. The fresh pasta with truffles and cheese is especially great. However, the portions for lunch may be a little small for men. (Nuke Valley)

#### **Hannya PANNYA CAFE CURRY (curry/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Suzuki Building 1F, 2-33-6 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/a7B86Kq7G5N2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### A curry shop owned by Mr. Takashi Matsuo, which is now a long-established restaurant in Shimokitazawa, a curry battleground. The curry is unique, like a soup curry, and those who like it will become addicted to it. This is the restaurant I went to the most in Shimokitazawa. If I don't go for two weeks, I start to feel withdrawal symptoms. Personally, I recommend the half-and-half chicken and keema. (Nuke Valley)

#### **Peacock Store (super/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`2-25-21 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/j2zFukngNd72){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### Shimokitazawa has an unbelievable variety of lunch options, including ramen, curry, and stylish caf√© food, but sometimes you may want to tighten the purse strings. In such cases, the Peacock Store can help you out. The store has a wide selection of retort curry, and you can enjoy the time spent in front of the shelves wondering which one to choose. They have a wide variety of curries, but the best ones are the private brand ones, which are less than 100 yen and taste great. If you want to go all out, you can mix in some Newcomb Meat for a richer taste. If you want to go big, you can mix in some Newcomb Meat for a richer taste, and if you buy some vegetable juice and dessert with it, everything is perfect. (Inui.)

#### **day laborer (ramen/10 minutes walk)**
##### [***`2-19-17 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/mZR6ZoAsu4C2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### As a young person, I would be satisfied if I ate meat and carbohydrates, but when I am influenced by social trends and think about my health, I sometimes think, "I should eat vegetables ....... In such a case, Hidakaya's "Vegetable-filled Tanmen" is the perfect choice. You can eat it as a normal meal, but if you are a health-conscious person who is more concerned about sugar content, I recommend the "less noodles" option. If you eat a lot of vegetables and drink up the soup, you will have a healthy and satisfying lunch. (Inui.)

#### **Shoeiya (soba/7 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Coop Sunrise 1F, 3-21-1 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/Nbx6C4f5dMF2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a long-established soba noodle shop located near the entrance to the Ichibangai shopping street. You may be hesitant to enter because of its old-fashioned and austere appearance, but it is a homey store where the waitresses talk to you in a friendly manner. The Chinese noodles are priced at 540 yen, which is quite reasonable for Shimokitazawa. There is also a menu item for carbohydrate lovers called "Ojiya Curry Udon," where rice gruel is served after finishing the curry udon. (this world)

#### **Matsuya (rice covered with beef and vegetables/10 minutes walk)**
##### [***`1F Matsumoto Building, 2-19-13 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/A1nCutf4so32){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### Shimokitazawa has many fashionable restaurants, but there are also many chain restaurants. Among them, Matsuya is located near my high school, college, and the company I joined after graduation, and the "Negishio Pork Kalbi Don" is one of my favorites, a taste of my youth. It is also the only one of the major gyudon (beef bowl) chains (I think) that is generous enough to offer miso soup with their rice bowl menu. As a young person who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on lunch, I am glad that I can drink the miso soup first and then eat the rice, which gives me an overwhelming feeling of fullness without having to order a big bowl. After eating, you can walk straight to graniph to look at t-shirts or a used book store, which will surely make your lunch break perfect. (Inui.)

#### **mixture (bread/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`3-31-5 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/7UirfaBv5XT2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a simple bakery located in Ichibangai. Compared to the bakeries with foreign names that have recently moved into Ginza and Shinjuku, it feels really simple, but this simplicity with a sense of the Showa era is what makes this store special. The slightly sweet bread dough is my personal favorite. (Nuke Valley)
###### It opens at 7:30 in the morning, so you can eat freshly baked bread every morning. I buy bread from this store about three times a week before I go to work. (Ikeda)
###### This store offers simple breads. Personally, I recommend the walnut bread and pretzel bagels. They are open early in the morning, so I often buy some on my way to work before I leave. (large building)

#### **private residence temporarily taking lodgers (Ramen/Chinese/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`2-8-8 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/xM5FyNS6AsE2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### It is a famous old-established ramen shop in Shimokitazawa that is loved by many celebrities. The rundown interior (excuse the pun) gives the impression of a store that has been around since the Showa era. The taste is the same as good old Showa-era soy sauce ramen, but the taste is so light that you never get tired of it, and it makes you want to eat it from time to time. The red fried rice made with food coloring also has an impact. (Nuke Valley)
###### This is a so-called "Kitana Shuran" restaurant. For starters, you can't go wrong if you order the "Rachan" (ramen and fried rice set). If you want to eat with gusto, this is the place to go. I also like the large tatami room on the second floor, where you can relax. (large mansion)

#### **Moona. (curry/7 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Hososawa Building 5F, 2-12-13 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/3NHwXm1BvDy){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### It is a rather long-established curry restaurant in Shimokitazawa. In Shimokitazawa, where there are many caf√© curries, the South Indian style curry is a minority, and the daily fish curry is prepared in the South Indian style. The quantity of the curry is quite small for men, but the taste is definitely good, and you can enjoy the carefully prepared curry. (Nuke Valley)

#### **eureka (bistro/1 minute walk)**
##### [***`102A, Elfair City Shimokitazawa II, 2-28-7 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/P6puQs7tiw42){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This bistro is located right in front of our office. I moved from Ikenoue to the current location at the same time that Baisi was coming to the current building. Recently, the management has changed and the restaurant is mainly used for lunch, but it is still a great place to get a delicious Western lunch. It is a bistro, but the rice is surprisingly good. (Nuke Valley)

#### **pleasant taste (Japanese-style meal/7 minutes walk)**
##### [***`Shimada Building B1F, 2-12-11 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/tFsyQ9hFPjA2){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is the place to go for Japanese food in Shimokitazawa. You can enjoy delicious Japanese food with vegetables and fish. They have a huge menu, but all of them are delicious without fail. I think this is probably my favorite Japanese pub in Japan, not just in Shimokitazawa. It is often frequented by theater groups, and sometimes famous actors come here. (Nuke Valley)

#### **La Befana Shimokitazawa (Italian/5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`5-31-3 Chiyoda, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/ydzegQJUpXG2){class = "maplink"}

&nbsp;
###### This Italian restaurant is often used for meals with my colleagues. The waitresses are excellent and the food is not only delicious, but the set menu available is also very reasonably priced, so I use this restaurant for lunch with my acquaintances and people from other companies. (long field)

#### **Rojiura Curry SAMURAI. Shimokitazawa (Soup curry / 5 minutes walk)**
##### [***`31-14, Kitazawa 3-chome, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo`***](https://goo.gl/maps/7eA7gS32ery){class = "maplink"}
&nbsp;
###### This is a soup curry restaurant from Hokkaido, which is relatively new in the fiercely competitive curry district of Shimokitazawa. It is a very popular restaurant with people always waiting in line, and has recently opened a curry shop with a different concept and a curry ramen store in Shimokitazawa, becoming a famous group in Shimokitazawa. With its delicious vegetables and sweet soup curry, it's no wonder it's so popular. (Nuke Valley)
