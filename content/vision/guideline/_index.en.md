### Action Guidelines

**In order to define what skills employees should learn and what they should be aware of in their work, we have prepared three action guidelines.**

{{< tableofcontent >}}

#### Be someone who can talk business with users.
**Engineers tend to focus on the details of the system, such as screen items and specifications, and tend to forget the original purpose of the development, which is to bring value to the client's business. It is also important to keep in mind that systems are strongly connected to management. If the user and the system are not on the same page because of a lack of management perspective, it is a loss for both the user and the company. The important thing is to work together with the users to communicate cost-effective requirements, specifications, and designs in terms that can be easily understood, and to gain their trust.** And then lead the IT project. More importantly, we can bring in profits that will lead to the promotion of key people within the customer. If you can do business in this way, you will be a special person to your customers.

#### Acquire skills that are rare and in demand.
If you are an engineer, focus your efforts on learning technologies that are needed but rare in the world. Specifically, **time series AI analysis, the use of big data, and cognitive services that recognize text and voice**. The first step is to hone your engineering skills in the cloud. Despite this, many people tend to want to do data science first. Before that, learn software engineering first. This is because it is easy to go from being an engineer to a scientist, but the opposite is hard to do because it is too heady. Don't be fooled by the hype of cutting-edge technology and AI, just keep working steadily and you will find your way.

#### Get the most out of the least amount of work.
**Don't just stick to what you want to do, but also understand the needs of your customers and the market**. Also, focus on results rather than how hard you work. In fact, you will be more productive if you can get results without working too hard. I hope that you will find a way to enjoy your work and get results. And don't be swayed by your own motivation, but work with **profit as your driving force**. If you can put these things into practice, you can become an engineer, manager, or executive who can work in any environment.
