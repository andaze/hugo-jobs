### Industry Challenges

**In order to support a wide variety of corporate challenges, we provide three main types of services with our global innovation class technology. There will be many situations where you can challenge new things.**

{{< tableofcontent >}}

#### Facing the challenges of the field with the latest existing technologies

One of our missions is to **solve issues that companies are facing in the field** through the use of AI. We use existing technologies to realize "what would be great". For example, to prevent picking errors in logistics, AI can read the words on cardboard boxes; to prevent accidents among long-distance drivers, AI can use facial recognition to alert the driver if he or she falls asleep; and to ensure accurate accounting, AI can detect input errors and notify the driver.  
We are not in the business of creating new technologies from scratch.However, companies are being called upon one after another to reduce the myriad of **"tasks that robots and AI are better at," and to improve operational efficiency.**  
And since AI technology is not yet versatile enough to handle grand projects, focusing on these niche issues will increase the success rate of development.

#### Creating Value through the Use of Big Data

Today, IoT is becoming more and more widespread in the home, with home appliances such as air conditioners, lights, and refrigerators being connected to the Internet. A large amount of data is being generated here and there. For example, a device is placed in the back of a truck, and information such as the indoor temperature and where the truck is currently driving is sent once every five minutes. As this data grows exponentially, it swells into big data that old technology cannot handle. Just backing up all this data is a challenge. Some customers ask, "I've installed the device, but how do I handle the massive amount of data?" We have been receiving more and more consultations from customers who are troubled by this question. **We are responding to the needs of the market by using the cloud and providing technology that can balance functionality, performance, and cost**.

#### Support new business at a fast pace

In recent years, the speed at which new businesses and projects can be launched in about six months is required. System development for this purpose is essential. **Creating a system that allows mobile phones, tablets, and PCs to work together in the cloud** is also necessary, as well as strengthening security to prevent information leaks.  
**We have obtained ISO27001 certification, the international standard for information security. Quality is managed by ISO9001**. In addition, we use the DevOps** methodology to accelerate our development speed. We respond to the needs of a market that demands speed.
