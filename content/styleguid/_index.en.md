# Style Guid

## Headings
---
#  Heading level 1
##  Heading level 2
###  Heading level 3
####  Heading level 4
#####  Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

## Alternate Syntax
---
Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.

Heading level 1
===============
Heading level 2
---------------

## Paragraphs
---
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

## Line Breaks
---
To create a line break (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

## Emphasis
---
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

### Bold
I just love **bold text**.   
I just love __bold text__.

### Italic
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.   
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.

### Bold and Italic
This text is ***really important***.
This text is ___really important___.

## Blockquotes
---
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Nested Blockquotes
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Blockquotes with Other Elements
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

## Lists
---
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

### Ordered Lists
1. first Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth Item

### Unordered Lists
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
  * Indented item
  * Indented item
* Fourth item

## Code
---
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks ().
At the command prompt, type `nano`.

## Code Blocks
---
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

## Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

***
