##### **`This is who I am.`**

###### I usually draw illustrations (mostly doodles), go to art and graphic design exhibitions, and occasionally make handmade accessories. I like cloth, paper, textiles, and miscellaneous goods, so I am hoping to go to events related to them this year. The music I often listen to while traveling is Spitz, Fuji Fabric, and YUKI. I don't know that many artists, so I'm thinking that I should broaden my range. I like animals in general, but I think our good-natured pug and unassuming Chihuahua are the cutest.

##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### I joined the company last year as a designer. To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing, and I was vaguely worried. However, even in such a situation, there is a solid support system in place, and experienced seniors will carefully teach you not only design work but also any other points you don't understand, making it an environment where even those with no experience can work with peace of mind. In addition, there is nothing wasted in daily design work, and I am always learning. Although it can be hard at times, it is rewarding to realize the joy of seeing something you have worked on used in the world.
