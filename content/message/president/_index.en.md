###### In today's world where job changes are commonplace, which company you work for first may no longer be a major choice. Nevertheless, it is highly likely that you will be able to build a foundation at that company, and if the first company you work for is a good one, it will definitely have a positive impact on your career later on.

###### If Baisi is to be the "first company" where you start working as a creator, we must accept this responsibility and properly teach you the important things about work that you can pass on to your 30s and 40s.

###### Going into an unknown job is not all fun and games. You may be more worried about unreasonable bosses, scary seniors, demanding clients, the stress that builds up, and the limitations of your skills. It's true that the workplace at Baisi is not always easy. However, many of the things that are common to all jobs are quite normal. If you are not good at the obvious things, you will never be able to find your place in the world. So, first of all, you need to acquire the basic "working mindset".

###### If you have a working mindset, you won't mind a few barriers. If you have a working mindset, you will not blame others for the barriers and feel stressed about them, but you will see them as your own business and use them as opportunities for growth. In this way, work will become fun, not hard.

###### There are several ways to acquire a working mindset, but to put it bluntly, the first thing to do is to take the company and your seniors' ideas into consideration. You will eventually get used to it faster if you put aside your own obsessions for the moment and just immerse yourself in the work. A person's individuality is not so weak that it can be lost.

###### However, there may be some conditions for this as well. That is, to work for a company that has a clear vision for hiring and training, a company that is not afraid of change, aims higher, and has a high perspective. Being a large company or having good benefits has nothing to do with fostering a work ethic. What is important is the concentration and density of the work. On the other hand, if you learn to take it easy at a company with low density and concentration, it may cast a dark shadow on your career later on.

###### We at Baisi aim to be a top-level web production company that understands the essence of the web and is able to combine marketing and creativity. We are aiming to continue to grow and are willing to take on the challenge of launching our own services. I intend to create an environment where I can gain valuable experience, where I can grow strongly while watching the company grow before my eyes.

#### **For people in their 20s who are applying with experience**
&nbsp;
###### In your twenties, it is time to thoroughly improve your "technical skills. Whether it is design, coding, programming, marketing, UX, sales, recruiting, or management, if you can create a specialized area in your 20s where you can say that you are better than everyone around you, that you know the most in your company, and that you are one of the best in your industry, you will be able to advance your career. This will give you an advantage in your future career.

###### In order to achieve this, it is important to set a "natural level". Being "better than anyone else" in an environment where you can work at a low level may not work when you go outside the company. If you put yourself in an environment where you can work at a high level, and if you continue to pursue your skills without compromising yourself, you will be able to enter your 30s with confidence.

###### However, when you look at your thirties and beyond, you can see the limits of what you can cross with your technical skills alone. If you have learned the basics of work skills in your twenties, you will be able to make a big difference in your thirties and beyond. The difference between those who have learned the basics of work skills in their 20s and those who have not can be significant in their 30s and beyond.

###### It may sound harsh, but I often see scenes of people in their thirties who are all about technical skills, who cannot read and understand the business context, who have a poor and sketchy work style, who are not team players, who have no solid philosophy in their work, and who see things only through idealism and righteousness, and who are not trusted by the company or customers and lose their reputation. While working on your technical skills, you also need to finish laying the foundation for your work skills in your 20s.

###### We understand the importance of UI design and front-end/server-side technologies, and place great emphasis on the pursuit of quality.

###### On the other hand, since our style is to directly confront the client company, we also place great importance on being business-oriented. No matter how good your design or system is, if you can't see things from a business perspective, you can't build a good relationship with your clients and contribute to their business. Not being able to contribute to the business means not being able to take initiative and having to work at the mercy of someone else all the time. In order to work in the style we want, we need to be able to drive the business. To do this, not only technical skills but also work skills are essential.

###### I believe that with our company, you can develop your work skills while polishing the technical skills that you should focus on in your 20s. If you can relate to our ideas, please try knocking on the door of Bage.

###### If you're considering a career change, you probably already have a specialty.

###### However, depending on the environment in which you have been working, you may find that there are areas in which you are lacking in your areas of expertise.

###### In addition to this, they are expected to be able to motivate others, to demonstrate their ability to work and to produce results beyond what they could do on their own, based on the advanced expertise they acquired in their 20s.

###### In their thirties, many people start families and don't have as much free time as they did in their twenties. In their thirties, when the environment changes from their twenties to their thirties, their reputation is determined not only by their technical ability to catch up with trends, but also by their universal skills that do not drift with the times.

###### As a web production company, we value technical skills, and our environment is perfect for honing them. On the other hand, one of our major strengths is our sense of balance in terms of business. As a company that caters to businesspeople from general companies and promotes projects through direct communication, Baisi is the perfect place to train "universal skills that do not drift with the times," such as business communication and organizational management.

###### When you are in your thirties, there is no time to be lost. You have to decide on the path you want to take, set your mind to it, and do the best you can. This is not an age when you can make excuses. However, this is also the time when you are given a great deal of discretion and work becomes even more enjoyable.

###### I am proud to say that we have the environment to meet the needs of people in their 30s.
