### **Current status and issues in the industry**
&nbsp;
Our vision and training policies are closely intertwined with the current situation and future of the web/IT industry, and are premised on our awareness of these issues. In this page, we explain our thinking in this area.

#### **Rapidly shifting trends**
&nbsp;
###### The web/IT industry is characterized by rapid changes; it is not unusual for a situation to change in a year or two, and for a job to disappear in five or ten years. For example, Flash, the web animation technology that took the world by storm in the 2000s, is no longer in use. Many of the techniques that Flash creators worked so hard to acquire back then have become obsolete and are no longer useful. On the other hand, the market for smartphones, which did not exist at all back then, has rapidly expanded since 2010 and has become the mainstream of today.
###### In this way, the dynamic changes that we take for granted now will disappear, and what we don't have now will become the norm, will continue in the future. In other words, in such a rapidly changing environment, you must not only hone the skills needed now, but also acquire universal skills that will not become obsolete in five to ten years, or you will be at risk of losing your place in the workforce.

#### **Us in 2030**
&nbsp;
###### Let's imagine what it will be like in 2030. Devices other than smartphones will be diversified, everything will be connected to the Internet, cities will become smart cities, and AI-like technologies will support people's lives. The technology to process the huge amount of data being collected will evolve further, and many of the time-consuming but not so mind-numbing tasks we do today will be automated, enabling marketing that is directly connected to people's psychology and behavioral characteristics.
###### As technology continues to evolve, there is no doubt that UI will continue to evolve and diversify. With devices that do not have large screens, UIs will be closer to the body and more intuitive, making their presence unnoticeable, and frameworks for UIs and implementation techniques will be developed, making it easier for developers to use advanced ones. As frameworks for UIs and implementation techniques become available, developers will be able to easily use advanced ones. The current market of creating tailor-made UIs for use on a PC screen is likely to shrink. And with numerous automation technologies, designers and engineers will be freed from much of the routine work that is at the core of their current skills, and will enter an era where more essential results are required.
###### When we imagine such a world 10 years from now, how should we utilize the skills we currently acquire in our web jobs?

#### **The negative effects of division of labor and uniformity**
&nbsp;
###### As industries mature, not just web production, there is a tendency for division of labor so that each person's specialties can be efficiently combined to produce high-quality output at higher speeds, in larger volumes, and more productively. However, designers and engineers working in an environment with a high degree of division of labor have fewer opportunities to be exposed to peripheral skills, and their career paths become fixed.
###### For example, a person who does HTML coding tends to be stuck in a situation where no matter how much work he does, he can only acquire HTML coding skills and cannot get a chance to change his job to UI designer or director.
###### Also, uniform job definitions such as "you have to work this way because you are a designer or an engineer" can lead to people who cannot cope with change. There is a wide variety of people in this world, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and interests. If we do not become accustomed to working in a way that accommodates such diversity, it will be difficult to develop people and organizations that can walk flexibly through an era of frequent change.

#### **Business-centered thinking that makes you stronger**
&nbsp;
###### In recent years, "design" has become a boom word in the business world, with terms such as UX design and design thinking spreading even among non-designers, and it is no longer unusual to hear these terms used in management meetings. This growing interest in design at the business layer is a sign of an expanding market and a great business opportunity.
###### At the same time, however, designers who cannot make proposals in a business context will be left behind in this trend. In traditional production and design companies, design and business were separated, and designers did not have many opportunities to acquire business skills. However, in the future, production and design companies will be required to break this old framework and design services and systems with a business-centered design perspective that is appropriate for the current era.
###### This isn't just about design. The same applies to the engineering world. Especially if you are aiming for a position like CTO, knowledge and experience in management and organizational management are essential. Except for that one point where you are good at engineering, you are required to move in a way that is very similar to that of an ordinary businessperson. It is no longer enough to learn a new language, implement it according to the specifications, and have highly technical conversations with other engineers to be evaluated.
###### In this way, it is inevitable that professionals will become business people. This is because both design and systems were originally born out of business needs. The science of marketing and sales has evolved, tools have evolved, and the effects of design and systems can now be confirmed by numbers, making it easier to measure the business results of design and systems.

#### **Difficulties in Training People**
&nbsp;
###### As I have mentioned so far, the speed of change is fast and business orientation is becoming stronger. This is because a stable business is the basis for a stable training and working environment.
###### However, the production and design companies that are able to market well, select their clients carefully, and manage their projects well are still in the minority. Many of them are always short on time, and while they may be able to teach the task at hand, they rarely have the marketing and leadership training. I have seen many companies lose the trust of their clients and the business side because they have not been trained to do the usual things such as not meeting deadlines, not working without prompting, and only doing what they are told.
###### On the other hand, large operating companies have more time to spare. However, there is another problem here. The problem is that there is no culture to train designers and engineers. Since there is no culture, there are no evaluation standards or training policies. Since there are no ideas or philosophies about design or systems, it is not uncommon for companies to just copy other companies ad hoc, rather than planning ahead. In addition, because they have plenty of time, they tend to use their time in a low-density manner.
###### If you become accustomed to this kind of "haphazard work style without planning," you run the risk of struggling to grow when you reach your 30s and 40s and are required to engage in advanced communication in business and management. However, many companies do not think about the future and hire young creators for the sake of immediate sales and business, leaving them to work haphazardly.

###### Our training policies and internal systems were born out of our awareness of the problems of this situation.

Considering these future predictions and the current situation, you can see in the following pages what kind of training policy we have in place.
