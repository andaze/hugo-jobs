### **Our mistakes.**
&nbsp;
###### In the introduction so far, you may have thought that maybe Baisi is a perfectionist company, where no mistakes are made and no mistakes are tolerated. You may have thought so. But in reality, we have experienced many mistakes. Many of our workflows and internal systems have been born out of some kind of failure.

###### Here, I would like to share with you some of our failures, carefully selecting only the ones that can be disclosed to the public and choosing the right words.

###### We are not a perfect company. We will probably make many mistakes in the future. We hope to grow together with our employees through repeated failures.

#### **Failure 1ï¼šI made a series of mistakes during the release.**
&nbsp;
###### The management of human error is a major challenge for production companies that will last forever. Naturally, we have failed to do so and have made mistakes countless times. In order to avoid repeating such bitter experiences, we have implemented the following practices to keep the error rate as low as possible.

##### **Measure 1) Definition and formulation of the checking process**
###### If the check items are clear, the incidence of errors will be reduced. With this in mind, we have organized and documented the check items to be performed at each timing of the production process, such as before, during, after, before test release, just before release, and just after release. There are nearly 10 types of these check sheets. In addition, these processes are clearly described in the workflow so that the project does not proceed without checks.
&nbsp;

##### **Measure 2) Automating the checking process**
###### There is a limit to the number of errors that can be reduced to zero by visual or manual checking alone, no matter how much we unify our minds and put our energy into it. Unfortunately, with today's technology, it is not possible to mechanize everything, but we are trying to automate the checking process by using tools as much as possible. We are also working on creating our own tools for checking. For example, we are using tools that we have made ourselves to unify notation and find typographical errors.
&nbsp;

##### **Measure 3) Multi-person checking process**
###### Among errors, there are those that are allowed to occur and those that are very bad if they do occur. Examples of the latter include contact links, phone numbers, lead capture forms, various tag settings, and security for functions that handle personal information. In order to prevent errors of the kind that could lead to loss of sales opportunities and corporate trust, we have a system in place where critical but non-automatable check items are checked by multiple people.
&nbsp;

##### **Measure 4) Close communication and sharing of values**
###### One of the advantages of using the web is that errors can be fixed immediately. In most cases, speed is more important to the business than quality, which does not affect the results. It is also important to share this understanding with the client and create a project environment that does not obsess over minor errors. For example, at Baisi, we talk about the fact that mistakes are bound to happen from the beginning of the project, and we recommend that the project be released for testing at a rough stage, and that the project be released with only minor checks, and that detailed checks and improvements be made after the release.
&nbsp;

##### **Measure 5) Sharing failures**
###### Have you ever heard of VCUA, an acronym for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity? There are many VCUAs in web production and design work, and therefore, it is not possible to eliminate failures. However, it is possible to share the failures that have occurred and prevent them from happening again. At Baisi, we try to avoid repeating the same mistakes as much as possible by sharing the mistakes in the closing meeting and reflecting them in the workflow and documents.

#### **Failure 2: I couldn't get the "exchange of intentions" right, so I got lost.**
&nbsp;
###### If you don't know the "real purpose" of marketing, design, and engineering, you will not be able to think and act in the right direction. That is why it is very important to know the customer's intentions directly. It also leads to a healthy discussion with the customer because the proposal's intentions can be properly and directly communicated. This is called "exchange of intentions." Without this exchange of intentions, you will not know how to propose, and as a result, you will be at the mercy of the customer and can only respond in a perfunctory manner.

###### In the days when I was working for a major production company or agency, this "failure to exchange intentions" often occurred. There were times when we made proposals that were out of sync with the client's true intentions and had to repeat them over and over again, times when our intentions were not conveyed and we were judged unilaterally, and times when we lost the trust of the client, who wondered if the company was safe.

###### Of course, there were problems with our own communication skills, but I think the fundamental problem was that we couldn't talk directly to the customers and the customers didn't understand the company.

###### So now, with a few exceptions, we refuse to accept subcontracted work and only accept work directly from our clients. Of course, we couldn't suddenly become a "direct contract only" company, so we have been focusing on marketing, service design, and organization. The reason why we insist on direct contracting is not because we are stubborn or proud, but because we have learned from these mistakes.

#### **Failure 3: Took on unfamiliar work, but couldn't handle it.**
###### From a management point of view, repeating the same job over and over again is risky, and sometimes you have to take on a new challenge. However, there were times when such decisions backfired and we failed.

###### For example, a few years ago, we received an order for a large system development project that was too large for us to handle. At the time, we had less than 10 people working on the project, so we took the lead in terms of business distribution and placed the order with another system development company to carry out the project. We thought we could simply act as an intermediary by introducing the development company to the customer and creating a direct communication relationship, but this was a big mistake.

###### In particular, those of us who are accustomed to smooth project progress were not accustomed to dealing with problems such as development delays and defects in unfamiliar system projects, and we could not handle the situation well, which led to further confusion. In the end, we were able to delay the deadline for delivery and release, but it was a project that left a bitter memory.

###### As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, an attitude of challenging new tasks instead of routine ones is very important in the long run. However, it would be meaningless if we only take on reckless challenges, resulting in confusion in the workplace, loss of trust from customers, and employees quitting. For this reason, we are now taking care to take on work in a way that allows us to take on "appropriate challenges" based on a clear awareness of our areas of expertise.

#### **Failure 4: Gradually, I started coming home later and later, and the last train became the norm.**
###### For a while after October 2010, when we built the office and had two staff members, we did not leave the office very late. Even if there were days when we were a little late, it didn't last long. However, as the number of employees increased to four, five, and six, the working hours became longer and longer, and by around 2014, it became the norm to go home after the last train. This was one of the reasons why some of us left the company. As a result, in 2015, we set a time limit and started forcing employees to go home at a certain time.

###### This initiative is being implemented in stages, and currently the time limit is 21:00 on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and 19:00 on Wednesdays, and we have also introduced the much maligned Premium Friday on the last Friday of the month. Naturally, we almost never work on Saturdays, Sundays, and national holidays, but in the event that we do, we try to take a compensatory day off as soon as possible.

###### This initiative is ongoing, and our ultimate goal is to leave the office at 19:00 on all days. Some people think that making top-down rules like this will undermine the autonomy of employees, but since there are so many different ways of thinking about working hours, we think it is necessary to clearly state the recommended standards for the company.

###### In terms of the working environment, we have made flexible decisions including remote work during bad weather, childcare leave for male employees, and irregular early retirement, etc. In addition, we have structured our work and reduced areas of dependency as much as possible so that projects can proceed without delay even when vacancies occur.

###### Although we still have a long way to go, we, including the management team, will work together to further raise awareness of the working environment and continue to take prompt measures.

#### **Failure 5: I continued to work in a vague manner and got confused at the end of the day.**

###### The negative effects of ambiguous and loose work are more likely to occur at the end of a project, when time is limited, than at the beginning, when there is plenty of time. The project, which took about a year to complete, seemed to be progressing smoothly in the early and middle stages, but the negative effects of numerous unclear communications, lack of explanations, and aggressive schedule setting that forcibly replaced tasks were all exposed in the final stages, causing a great deal of confusion.

###### We had always had a well-defined workflow for our work. However, with more than 10 staff members and a growing scale of work, it was clear that the old workflow was failing. Immediately after this failure, we quickly formed a workflow improvement team, set up a forum to solicit opinions from all employees, and spent about four months reviewing the workflow. The standard workflow was broken down into about 140 tasks, and the documents and job functions in charge were also reviewed.

###### In external interviews, we uniformly say that no matter how well we structure our work, there will be one or two projects a year that don't work out. However, thanks to this latest workflow, we did not have any notable problems in 2018. Of course, this depends on the characteristics of the case, so do not evaluate it easily. However, it can definitely be said that one of the reasons is that the latest workflow reduces the probability of failure and improves the quality of service.
