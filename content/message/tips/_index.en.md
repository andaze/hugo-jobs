### Hiring Tips

**For those who are interested in joining Andaze. We have put together some useful advice for your entry and interview process. We hope that you will find this information useful when applying for a job and that it will make your job search more meaningful.**

{{< tableofcontent >}}

#### I'll look into Andaze.

https://andaze.com/jobs/ The job site of Andaze has information about the features of Andaze and the people we want. Also, check out https://www.andaze.com/ja/services to see what kind of technology they offer. If there is a word that interests you, check it out, it may stimulate a new interest.

#### Your motivation will give you an edge.

You don't need to write a big reason for your application. What do you think is right for you at Andaze, what do you think you can learn, and what do you want to do? Put together the natural thoughts that come to your mind.

#### Let's talk about technologies and services that have impressed you.

Are there any technologies or services that you think are superior or intriguing, such as "this AI function is amazing" or "that company's system is getting better and better"? As you use and research various IT tools on a daily basis, you will naturally keep up to date with fresh information.â€¯What services have you found to be great?  
For example, in the past they have mentioned

<div class="table-width">

|**DeepL translation**|This is a revolutionary service that surpasses the translation functions of Google and Microsoft. The accuracy is so high that professional translators have praised it, and the number of Japanese users is increasing dramatically.|
|---|---|
|**Amazon Customer Service**|If you have any questions about shipping problems, you will get an answer in a matter of seconds and the chat will solve the problem in no time. There is no stress of not being able to get through to customer service or having to wait.|

</div>

etc. If you're a regular reader, you'll often see the latest technology-related news on Google Discover on your smartphone. If there is a technology that you think is great, please talk about it in the interview.

#### Be honest about why you left your previous job.

I would like to hear positive reasons such as "because I want to grow more," but I think some of you may have been struggling in an environment where you cannot foresee the future. You may not be satisfied with the work you are doing, you may feel that there is a lot of waste, you may not enjoy it, and you may not feel motivated. Please tell us honestly why you decided to resign. I promise you that you will not experience the same kind of distress as you did in your previous job.

#### I'll be able to tell you my shortcomings.

No one is perfect without flaws or weaknesses. If you are concerned that you are not good at explaining things, for example, please don't hesitate to talk about it. What may be a weakness to you may be attractive to us. The important thing is that you are aware of your weaknesses. It's important to be aware of your weaknesses, because "knowing your weaknesses = knowing where to improve". The right person in the right place can make up for the weaknesses of each member, so I don't think there is a problem as long as there is a balance with the strengths.

#### You're a nerd. You're a respectable person who is passionate about one thing.

If you feel that you might be a geek, I think it is more of an advantage. Otaku are often perceived as "eccentric," but in reality, they are pure people who are interested in and passionate about one thing at a time. There is a purity to them that allows them to feel joy as if it were a game when even a small process produces the expected result. This personality is worthy of our respect. Please don't be shy to share your love of otaku with us.

#### The ability to speak is not directly related to the results.

If you don't have the confidence to speak well at an interview, or if you feel nervous, don't worry. We welcome even those who are not good at speaking. In our company, we have engineers who work quietly and reticently, but all of them have achieved results beyond our expectations. All of them have achieved more than expected results, and we have a great deal of trust in them as they quietly polish their technical skills and master a variety of technologies. If you don't have any language skills, there is no problem at all by using the machine translation service.  
During the interview, we will focus on your technical skills rather than your communication skills, so please tell us about your experience and the knowledge you have learned.  
Incidentally, overseas, IT technology is more advanced in Northern Europe, where people spend more time indoors due to shorter daylight hours, than in Southern countries, where outdoor culture is thriving and communication between people is active. Even if you don't usually go outside or talk to people, there is a high possibility that you will be able to play an active role in our company.

#### Ask a lot of questions during the interview.

It is too late to say, "This wasn't supposed to happen! It's too late to say, "This wasn't supposed to happen!", so please ask as many questions as you can during the interview. "Will I be evaluated properly even if I work full-time remotely? "What kind of country is Japan? "What kind of work will I be entrusted with? These questions will be answered honestly and without embellishment. The fact that you have so many questions to ask us is a sign that you are interested in us.

#### Actively apply to other companies in your industry!

Changing jobs is a great opportunity to get to know a variety of companies. If you find a company that interests you, apply and listen to what they have to say. If, after comparing with other companies in your industry, you decide that you want to join Andaze, we will be happy to welcome you.

Next, I will introduce "automation" which has greatly increased the efficiency of our work and the quality of our products. All of these methods are currently being worked on by Andaze.
