### **Recruitment Tips**
&nbsp;
###### In the words of Sun Tzu, "If you know him and know yourself, you will never be defeated in a hundred battles. If you are going to apply for a job, you should know the hiring criteria of the company.

###### By the way, this is a method that will work well for other companies as well. I hope that these tips will help you in your job search and employment activities.

#### **Think of a natural motive for applying.**
&nbsp;
###### There are many people who apply for jobs on job change sites without writing (or thinking about) a motive for their application, but not having a motive for your application will only put you at a disadvantage. You don't have to compose a unique, grand story to explain your motivation. All you need to do is to put into words what you want to do and what you feel is right for you.

#### **Prepare as many pieces as possible.**
&nbsp;
###### Unfortunately, "I love the web" and "I will do my best once I join the company" are not enough to prove your enthusiasm. However, if you have many works, they will eloquently demonstrate your strong enthusiasm. There, quantity is more important than quality. Also, the more work you have done independently in your personal life as well as for work or school assignments, the better your reputation will be. This is because it shows that your desire to create is not an obligation, but a strong desire that comes from within.

#### **I'll show you what I'm clipping, too.**
&nbsp;
###### If you are actively gathering information on a daily basis, you may have posted useful information and reference designs on social bookmarks, Tumblr, Pinterest, etc. This kind of history will also prove your enthusiasm and willingness to gather information. If you can present not only what you have created, but also what you have been inspired by, we will be very interested.

#### **Peruse web sites, blogs, and daily reports.**
&nbsp;
###### At Baisi, we disseminate information through various channels such as our website, blog and daily reports. In particular, the blog and the daily report provide a glimpse into the values of the staff, their know-how, and the way they work. If you want to know more about Baisi, you should read through these websites as much as possible to get a better understanding of the company.

#### **Clarify the reason for leaving your previous job.**
&nbsp;
###### If you are changing jobs, there will always be a reason why you are (or were) leaving your previous job. Try to be as honest as possible about this. This is because if the problems you felt at your previous job are something that cannot be properly solved at the baiji, the relationship will not last long after all. In order to avoid negative comments, some people can answer with a single statement, "I want to go higher," but in the end, that will not help us understand what you really want. Please be honest and tell us what you think.

#### **Let's sort out the pros and cons.**
&nbsp;
###### Strengths and weaknesses are usually two sides of the same coin. Everyone has weaknesses, but not many people are aware of their own weaknesses. There is a technique for interviewing where you don't answer your weaknesses but replace them with your strengths, but this will only lead to the judgment that you don't know your weaknesses and won't say anything inconvenient. Make sure you have a clear idea of what you are good at and what you are not good at, and then speak honestly.

#### **Ask a lot of questions during the interview.**
&nbsp;
###### What is more important than what you answered in the interview is what questions you asked. If you don't ask any questions at all, or if you ask questions that can be easily understood by looking at the website, you may be judged as not being that interested in the company, or as having poor information gathering skills. Of course, this is not the only factor in deciding whether or not to hire someone, but if you have applied for a job and have been given the opportunity to interview, you should definitely gather information with the intention of being hired, and you should prepare as much as possible of what you want to ask.
&nbsp;

#### **Apply to as many companies in your industry as possible.**
&nbsp;
###### Some companies in the world don't like it when you apply to other companies in the same industry, but we think quite the opposite. We think it is natural for people to apply to multiple companies in the same industry if they have a strong interest in that job or profession. We are also happy if you choose us after looking at many different companies. We hope that you will find the best company for you after looking at many different companies. If you find the best company for you, we will welcome you with open arms.
