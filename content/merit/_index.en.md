##  Occupation Introduction
Since we undertake the entire process of web development, from strategy to development, we have all the skills to complete it. Here are some definitions of job functions that appear in internal conversations. However, we do not believe that all employees need to follow these uniform job definitions. For example, even if you have the same title of "director," the skills you acquire are not one and the same for each person. Rather than imposing a standardized skill set based on job titles, the system is structured so that each person can work freely according to their own wishes and aptitudes.

##### <a id="sectionBlock1"></a>Project Manager
It is sometimes abbreviated to PM. This position is responsible for budget management, team organization, WBS creation, security-related settings, internal communication, and legal procedures. While most of the work is done when a project is launched, they are also responsible for resource allocation, budget management, and schedule adjustment during the project's progress. Vage does not have a full-time project manager, but a director who also serves as a project manager.

Main Staff : Imanishi, Odachi, Gonoi, Furunaga

##### <a id="sectionBlock2"></a>consultant
This position is responsible for overseeing the strategic and creative aspects of a project, acting as the brains of the project and pursuing the marketing quality of the website. In particular, they play a central role in the strategy phase. The current consultants at Vage are primarily responsible for marketing, UX research and analytics, but may also include project management, creative direction, design and copywriting. It can be said that this is the position that requires the broadest knowledge and strategic thinking at Bayesi.

Major Responsibilities : Nuke Valley, Ootate, Furunaga

##### <a id="sectionBlock3"></a>UX Researcher
The main purpose of this position is to improve UX, from behavioral observation, user testing, online research, persona/journeying, workshop management, and idea generation. Research targets and methods are slightly different for web development and web applications. In web production, which has a strong marketing nature, the main focus is on analyzing prospective clients (leads) and customers rather than users. On the other hand, UI design for business systems, which is what we are starting to work on at Baisi, uses the so-called UX design approach. work related to UX can rarely be done by just thinking about UX, but rather it needs to be combined with management strategy, business strategy, capability, etc. I believe that if you don't think about management strategy, business strategy, capability, etc. in combination, you will not be able to come up with ideas that can be implemented. For this reason, we do not have a UX researcher as a specialized position within the company, but rather a consultant whose duties encompass all aspects of UX research.

Major Responsibilities: Nuke Valley, Imanishi, Otate

##### <a id="sectionBlock4"></a>director
Strictly speaking, this position focuses on production progress management. The main task is to communicate with clients and production staff. A director at Vage may also include the duties of a consultant or UX researcher, or a designer or engineer may also serve as a director. In this way, the duties of a director will vary depending on the individual's desires and aptitudes as well as the size and characteristics of the project. In any case, the director at Baisi is not a "do-it-yourselfer who manages the progress of the project," but rather an important post that is responsible for the communication part related to marketing and creativity.

Main staff : Imanishi, Odate, Gonoi, Furunaga

##### <a id="sectionBlock5"></a>Designer
The definition of "designer" is currently expanding to include areas such as service planning and UX research, but the main role of a designer at Vage is to create UI designs using Adobe XD and Photoshop. At Vage, wireframes, which used to be the domain of information architects and directors, are now the domain of designers. Therefore, designers are required to have an upstream understanding of strategy and logical design skills, and there are many opportunities to work on and support some of the proposals in the marketing and UX domains. In the development stage, designers are also responsible for motion design direction and usability checks and support for engineers. Although designers at Bage are in charge of creating visual elements with their hands, they do not only work on visuals, but also cover a wide range of positions related to solving essential issues.

Main Staff : Nigi Tsuji, Seikyu Kim, Takatsuka, Ikeda, Tsukamoto, Takashima, Shinyashiki

##### <a id="sectionBlock6"></a>copywriter
We believe that copy is a very important element in providing user and customer experiences, and the copy required for website content and the microcopy know-how required for UI design are different from traditional advertising copy and require a thorough understanding of the web and UI. For this reason, at Bage, copy is handled by directors and designers who excel in copy. Since there are few members who have specialized training in copywriting, we hold in-house study sessions to improve our copywriting skills. In addition, we are also making efforts to strengthen our copy and content skills by running our own daily report website at Bage.

Major Responsibilities : Fumigaya, Gonoi, Koga

##### <a id="sectionBlock7"></a>engineer
At Baisi, we do not distinguish between front-end engineers and server-side engineers, but rather refer to all of our staff as "engineers. This is based on the idea that there is no front-end or server-side implementation technology, and that all languages should be handled in a flat manner. In the early stages of development, we mainly implement HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and after the middle stage of development, we tend to handle WordPress and PHP. We also take the lead in documentation related to development and testing just before delivery and publication. As there are directors and designers in the company, there is relatively a lot of communication with non-engineers, and there is a monthly study session on JavaScript with assignments by external instructors, as well as several other study sessions, where information is actively exchanged within the company. Main staff: Nomura, Nagao

Main Staff : Nomura, Nagata, Sakai, Inoi, Nishimura, Urasaki, Kim, Hak-Gwan

##### Occupations that do not exist in the Vage
At Vage, we aim to organize our teams more efficiently. For this reason, we do not have the following positions within the company, but rather collaborate with outside experts when necessary.
- Sales representative
- Public Relations
- Human Resources
- Photographers
- Translation

What ties these multiple jobs together are the internal systems and events that arise from the workflow. In the following pages, we will introduce you to some of these internal systems and events at Baisi.
