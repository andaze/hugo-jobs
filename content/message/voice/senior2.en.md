#### `--Why did you decide to join Andaz?`
Previously, I worked as an office clerk at a publishing company. When I thought about my future career, I decided to join the IT industry because I thought it would be the industry that would drive the future trends. At first, I started out as a "side hustle" while remaining registered at my previous job. Six months later, I officially joined Andaz as a full-time employee.

#### `--Growth and change after joining the company`
Currently, I am assisting the PM in managing the progress of the entire project and providing operational support. Since all the materials and documents are managed digitally, the amount of paper I have to deal with has been greatly reduced. There are many challenging situations where I feel rewarded, such as when my ideas are used in meetings or when customers are pleased with my work. I also feel motivated by the free culture. I also enjoy the fact that I can communicate with foreign engineers in the company, sometimes using gestures.

#### `--Message to Applicants`
If you feel that the IT industry seems difficult, don't worry. The people around me will teach you what you don't know, and I was able to make a comfortable career change even though I had no experience in the industry. We also welcome people who want to start their careers with a second job, so let's realize a variety of work styles at Andaz.
