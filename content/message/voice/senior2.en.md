##### **`This is who I am.`**

###### Our policy for creating websites is to create realistic and challenging designs. I want to create a website that strikes a balance between ensuring functionality that is easy for the user to use and understand, while at the same time, emotionality that is not logical is also important. Recently, I am also interested in directing photography, and I enjoy working as a team with clients, photographers, and hair and makeup artists to create pictures. As a professional, I want to be able to do a certain level of work at any time and become someone who can help clients solve their business issues.

##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### Before I joined the company, I had the impression that there were no conversations at all during work and that there were many scary employees. However, this is not the case. We can communicate with each other easily regardless of age. It is a small company, so you don't have to worry about human relations, and it is an easy environment to work in. In my daily client work, I sometimes interact with management, which allows me to listen to the real business side of things and gain practical experience. Also, as a member of society, not only in my field of expertise, I can learn universal skills that can be applied to any company, so I can properly face my own career.
