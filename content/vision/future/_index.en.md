### **Future Vision of the Company**
&nbsp;
###### Our career path is based on the premise of developing our employees into creators who are resilient to changes in the environment and can contribute to the company for a longer period of time. In order to realize that career path, we must also have a clear plan for our company itself. Here, I would like to explain the future of Baisi.

#### **Future Business Plan**
&nbsp;
###### We have one business pillar that we have already established and two business pillars that we would like to establish in the future. For each of them, we have the following plan.
&nbsp;

##### **Web production for BtoB**
&nbsp;
###### This is our current core business. Since we have established our strengths, methods to attract customers, and management, we will continue to utilize these advantages to expand our business. Although the future of web production itself is uncertain due to the shift to AI in the production process, we will continue to aggressively evolve our services by strengthening our marketing proposal capabilities and integrating methods used in UX design and design thinking. However, we will not change our policy that our strength lies in both advanced strategic proposals and production capabilities that can bring them to fruition.
###### Although BtoB is externally presented as our field of expertise, about 20-30% of the projects we receive are BtoC projects. This is because there are areas in BtoC where BtoB know-how can be utilized, BtoB proposals can be deepened by knowing BtoC, and designers and engineers can be stimulated. For these reasons, we do not plan to completely specialize in BtoB in the future.
&nbsp;

##### **UX/UI design for business systems**
&nbsp;
###### This is a field that we are eyeing as the next pillar of our business after web production. The business system field, which has been the responsibility of SIers and system development companies, is a very large market, but it has also become a design wasteland, as UI designs created by engineers do not sufficiently improve business efficiency. There are only a few design companies that have ventured into this field, making it almost a blue ocean. Targeting this market, we have been building up our track record since around 2015.
###### We feel that there is a great potential in this area. There are many projects with large budgets, and prices can be set higher than for web production in the advertising field. Also, since design is required to be based on logic rather than sensitivity, we believe that we can increase the number of designers by building a design system and an education system for inexperienced designers.
###### However, due to the nature of the industry and other issues, we are seeing new challenges that we have not experienced in web production. We plan to fully utilize the knowledge we have gained through BtoB marketing to overcome these challenges and fully develop this field. We aim to have a 5:5 sales ratio with web production by around 2020. We are aiming for a 5:5 ratio of sales to web production around 2020.
&nbsp;

##### **In-house service**
&nbsp;
###### In the past, we have tried to develop our own services, but unfortunately, none of them saw the light of day. The main reasons for this can be summed up as a lack of structure and experience; launching an in-house service is not as easy as it seems for a small group of people working on the side of web production.
###### Because of this, we stopped this activity around 2014, but as our staff has increased and we have accumulated knowledge of various businesses through client work, we resumed the project of launching our own service in 2018. We haven't decided what we will create at this point, but we would like to plan "services that we want," "services that would help us," and "services that will make our personas into ourselves. Through this series of projects, we will also be developing the methodology of service development.
###### In addition, there are the following reasons for Bayzi to aim for a balance between contracting and in-house services.
###### The biggest advantage of contract business is that it allows you to understand the market firsthand, receive stimulation, and change on your own by interacting with companies in various industries. On the other hand, since it is a labor-intensive business, there is little risk, but no great return can be expected. Even if you streamline your processes and increase the scale of your business, it is still a world where you can only exceed 15% operating profit. It is a business model that makes it difficult to earn large profits.
###### With in-house services, you build a business from scratch. The barriers are very high and success is not guaranteed at all. However, if you can successfully establish yourself in this field, you can expect a high profit margin. Also, you can carry out experimental trials that you cannot try in client work under your own responsibility.
###### In this way, our goal is to create a company where we can take advantage of the advantages of contracting and the advantages of our own services to achieve synergy. Generally speaking, you have to focus on one or the other to make it work, but we would like to dare to challenge that.

#### **Staff Career Path**
&nbsp;
###### As you think about the future of your company, you will naturally think about the future of your staff as well.
###### Over the course of a long career, it is not uncommon for what you want to do and what is required of you to change, and for your job title to change. At that time, I would like to prepare a career path within the company as much as possible so that I can inherit the skills and knowledge I have cultivated so far, rather than having my career reset or having to change companies.
###### Specifically, as shown in the diagram below, we categorize skills into creative and management, clarify the skills and orientation required for each, respect the wishes of the individual, and try to provide a concrete path to success in the new position. In addition, we practice job rotation, switching jobs from time to time to provide opportunities for employees to experience new jobs.

&nbsp;
The reason why there are two types of people, creative and management, is because they have different basic ways of thinking. This is because the mission of the creative department is to challenge and destroy, while the mission of the management department is to maintain and adjust. However, it is only a matter of thinking style, and we believe that it is possible to change jobs. In our work, we aim to refine our skills not only in one area but also in the other from time to time.

In order to realize our vision of the future and the career paths of our employees, we need to accumulate our daily actions and share and foster our values. These values are clearly stated in the two action guidelines we have.
