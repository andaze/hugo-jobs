#### `--Why did you decide to join Andaz?`
I decided to join the company because I was looking for an opportunity to enhance my technical skills and I was impressed by the technology used in the development of the project. I also wanted to work on a global scale, so I moved my living and working base to Japan.

#### `--Growth and change after joining the company`
Currently, I am working as a solution architect, acting as a bridge between the customer and the development side.    
My experience in the field, where Japanese is spoken, has strengthened my technical skills and given me more confidence in communicating with customers. I believe that I am learning effective business communication skills.
