##### **`This is who I am.`**

###### I am from Hokkaido, Japan, and grew up surrounded by nature, so I love the outdoors. In my spare time, I go camping in the summer and skiing in the winter. I have been skiing for about 20 years, and I am confident that I am as good as anyone. Whenever I go back to Hokkaido, I always go to Niseko and upload videos taken with an action cam attached to my helmet on Instagram to get likes. I have also been fascinated by motor sports such as cars and motorcycles since I was a child, and I dream of going to see the Monaco Grand Prix of Formula 1 one day. My favorite car is a Honda motorcycle, which I have customized to my liking by painting it myself.

##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### I joined Bage as a new graduate. Since we are all working in the same space, we can easily consult with each other not only on coding, but also on design and backend. In addition, we always share the progress of our work, and there is an environment where we can help each other if we feel stuck in our work, so we never have to worry alone. Working together as a team to create a single website can be a challenge, but it is also very rewarding. The production process always requires high quality, so you will naturally be able to improve yourself. This is a good environment for those who want to improve their skills.
