intro: "We Work in Chiyoda Ward, where Andaz's headquarters is located, is a one-minute walk from Exit 6 of Hanzomon Station on the Hanzomon Line. The surrounding area is a very pleasant place to spend time, with many important national institutions, cherry blossom viewing spots, and delicious restaurants. Why not take a lunch break or after work and take a stroll around Hanzomon with its many attractions?"
