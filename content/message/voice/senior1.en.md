#### `--Why did you decide to join Andaze?`
I joined the company because I wanted to work remotely from my home in Gujarat, India. Currently, I am involved in product development, progress management, and training of junior staff. In the course of my work, I have been greatly impressed by the unique culture of Andaze, the projects we are working on, and the technology we are using. I have been able to learn a lot of new know-how.

#### `--Growth and change after joining the company`
I've been able to learn new technologies such as Azure and Blazor, and I've been able to play a great role in project management and team management to train young people.

#### `--Message to Applicants`
I think Anders is a very cool company and has a great vision for the future. It's also a great company for novice technicians. If you are interested in working with the latest technology, come and work with us.
