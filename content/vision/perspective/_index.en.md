### Andaze Mission.

**The word "Andaze" means "personal style" in Hindi. The company name expresses our hope that each employee's "personality" will shine through in their work.**

{{< tableofcontent >}}

#### Providing start-up development speed with corporate rules.

Our mission is to provide overwhelming development speed like a start-up within the corporate rules of social common sense and morality.

##### （*Examples of Mission Fulfillment）

Take the logistics industry, for example. Until now, logistics delivery information management has been based on the experience and intuition of skilled staff and experienced drivers. However, various conditions are involved in delivery operations, such as the progress of work, ever-changing road conditions, and the condition of workers and drivers. This is why we are using high-performance AI to solve problems that are beyond human capabilities, such as managing optimal delivery routes and driving details, and sorting packages, to create innovations that will dominate B2B logistics. In addition, we are also developing

We use the latest technology such as We are able to provide highly satisfactory services with the highest level of security and ease of use.

##### （*Means to achieve the mission）

**An iterative process will bring you closer to your ideal world.**  
As a means of increasing development speed, we have adopted an "iterative process". The iterative process is a development method that improves the quality of a system by repeating the following sequence of steps over and over again.

1. Development, measurement, and analysis are repeated.  
   ↓  
2. Feeding back the knowledge gained to the product  
   ↓  
3. I doubt if this is really the way to go.  
   ↓  
4. Match the product to its essence and purpose.  
   ↓  
5. Resetting entrenched values and ways of thinking  
   ↓  
6. Incorporate new ideas.

#### Indians' high level of technology is indispensable to realize the mission.

The birth of Andaze can be traced back to the representative's experience in Mumbai, India, where he was staying on business. The Indians working there were all demonstrating a high level of technical skills on a global level. However, the environment at that time was such that following plans and budgets were considered to be of utmost importance, and results were put on the back burner. The representative questioned such methods and returned to Japan in 2016. He founded Andaze, a company that can commit to "discovery" and "goals" using the latest technology. In order to achieve Andaze's mission, the power of talented Indian engineers is indispensable. To this end, we will hire a series of talented engineers from India's highest academic institutions to form a development team specializing in Microsoft's cloud technology.  
Currently, there are about 20 employees in India and 12 Japanese and non-Japanese employees in Japan. Conversations are mainly in English, but some departments use real-time translation tools for communication.

#### Hiring Indians who are valued by global IT companies

Global companies are actively accepting Indians.It is well known that the CEOs of prestigious organizations such as Google, Microsoft and Adobe are Indians.And it's not just about being selected for a top management position.

- **34% of people working at Microsoft**  
- **38% of physicians working in the U.S.**

India is a large country with more than one billion people and is said to have more than 20 official languages, including English, and a variety of cultures and religions. Because of its large population, competition within the country is fierce, and the country is highly adaptable to diversity, so it seems that the people of India have naturally acquired a national character that allows them to exert themselves globally even overseas. Incidentally, there are more than 20 Indian engineers working at Andaze.

#### If engineers don't find it "interesting," it's meaningless.

Gone are the days of silently listening to your boss and doing as you are told in order to get a monthly salary. And we believe that if a job doesn't feel right to us, we don't need to do it to sustain life. We trust and hand over authority when necessary, and support engineering with more freedom to achieve results.

####  Select projects that will bring new "discovery" and "value

Even if you are a customer, you will be able to work on exciting projects because they respect you as a member of the team to build the business together. For example, you can use new technologies such as **AI technology, big data, and IoT, or you can be involved in the development of new service projects**. In order to achieve the development speed of a startup, we select jobs that are **valuable** for engineers.

#### Be a reliable brain for your customers.

What we value in our relationships with our clients is not to be their hands and feet as a worker, but to be the brain that they value by maximizing their business value. For this reason, I place importance on **being able to create an equal relationship, utilize my knowledge and ingenuity, and acquire skills that can be used anywhere**.

#### Put employees first before contributing to society.

Whether the staff is working hard or not, and whether they are motivated or not may not be directly related to the business. Besides, before we talk about big dreams such as social contribution, we want to put our employees first. We believe that creating an exciting environment for everyone who loves information technology will lead to the best results.

#### Plans to increase the number of employees to approximately 100 in the future

We are planning to **increase the number of employees to around 100 in the future**, and once we reach 100, we will plan the next stage of our business, including the possibility of capital tie-ups with other companies. The staff living in India will work full-remotely while taking care of their "life in India," but there may be opportunities for them to travel to Japan for training, etc.

#### A career path that also opens up a professional future

{{< imagedisplay  src="スライド4.PNG"  >}}

Many people seem to think that management is an unavoidable path in their career as a technology developer. However, in our company, rather than uniting an organization, you can collaborate with each member to achieve great results, or gain experience by working alone on voluminous or difficult projects. Therefore, it is possible to develop a rich career path as a specialist.
