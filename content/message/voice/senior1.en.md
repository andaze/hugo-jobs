##### **`This is who I am.`**

###### I love female idols and often travel outside of the prefecture on my own. I'm the type of person who only watches live performances and is too afraid to participate in handshake events or anything that involves contact. I like to find cute logos and typography on the streets, and I tweet about them irregularly using the #SanpoTypo. Basically, I'm an indoor person who likes to spend time alone, but I also like to talk to people. I also like to talk with people, though it usually ends up being about work.

##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### I joined the company as a mid-career in October 2018. I experienced several companies before joining, but I feel that Baisi is a very easy environment to communicate with all employees.

###### Since the director, designers, and engineers are all in the same environment, I can ask any questions I have, and I feel that we are co-creating as a team, which is very rewarding every day.

###### I changed my career from a SE to a designer, but recently there have been many career changes from different industries to designers, and many people are wondering if they can make it. Of course, it is essential for you to make an effort. Of course, it is essential for you to make an effort, but I feel that there is a supportive environment in place.
