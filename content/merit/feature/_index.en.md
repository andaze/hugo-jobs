#### **Our strengths in business**

###### In recent years, attention to Bage has risen rapidly, and many requests for lectures and interviews have come in. In this way, despite being a small web production company, I think that the reason why it is attracting a lot of attention in the industry is that it is honestly continuing to study the three areas necessary for the web.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

###### **Marketing ability to grasp the business structurally and approach the essence of the problem**

###### In the strategic phase, we utilize a number of frameworks and repeat research and analysis for about two months, and the total number of documents produced during this period exceeds 300. This bold strategic proposal is the source of equal relationships with our customers. In addition, these findings are also utilized in our own management, and in 2017 we received more than 400 inquiries annually. There are few web production companies in Japan that have their own websites that produce such results. When you work at Bage, you can experience a marketing culture that is different for a web production company.    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
###### **Japan's highest level of design power**

###### We're incorporating marketing and UX design approaches into web production to pursue the essence of problem-solving design, but on the other hand, creative elements such as copy, photography, visuals, and engineering are also very much. I see it as an important element of design. In this way, we believe that everything from concept to styling and engineering details is necessary for "quality design", and we have established a system that can be consistent within the company.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
###### **Management ability to realize smooth project progress**
###### Even if you can propose a good marketing plan and design, the project will not succeed unless it progresses smoothly. In 2018, we created a workflow that was broken down into about 140 tasks based on the know-how cultivated in our work. Functions and documents are defined for each task, enabling highly productive project progress without personalization. In addition, sharing values, selecting customers, and integrating hiring strategies are essential for stable management. We have built a unique management model based on the Code of Conduct, and are designing an organization that allows business elements to work closely together and interact with each other.   

#### **Differences from other companies in the same industry**


&nbsp;
&nbsp;
###### Is it natural that a company involved in web production is good at marketing, design, and management? You might think that. However, many companies have areas of strength and weakness, and their business characteristics have a great impact on the way they work. Here we will explain the difference in detail.   

{{< imagedisplay  src="tableimg.png"  >}}



It is just a general classification, and in reality, each company has its own individuality. From the beginning, Bage's concept is to    
complete all of them in-house.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

###### **General web production company**
###### While they are good at design and development, they tend to be weak at marketing and management. Personal work styles have taken root, and there are some occasional jobs. It is the best environment to acquire skills in a short period of time, but because it is weak in business and cannot escape from the position of a production company, it is easy to fall into a slave relationship with customers and the workplace tends to be exhausted. In order to judge whether the working environment is healthy, it is necessary to confirm the ratio of direct transactions and specific management methods.  
&nbsp;
&nbsp; 

###### **General advertising agency**
###### My main business is to handle advertising in general, and I am not specialized in the web, and in many cases I outsource the production to an external partner company. Some companies retain their pre-Internet business practices and place more importance on customer relationships than rational judgment. Generally, it is difficult for designers and engineers to find employment, but there are cases where there is an in-house production team that focuses on operations. In that case, you will need to check what you are doing in your business.   

###### **General web marketing / consulting company**
###### Basically, I am good at planning marketing strategies using the web. While he is strong in strategic proposals and research, he is not familiar with web design and implementation, and he does not have much power to realize the project. Also, if you specialize in operational advertising, SEO, specific solutions, etc., it is important to sell the method, and you may be doing only a limited area of ​​marketing. It is difficult to find a job for a designer or engineer, but it is easy to choose a job for a consultant or director.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

###### **In the case of Bage**
###### As a business form, it has both aspects of a web production company that is strong in design and a web marketing company that is strong in marketing. Unlike advertising agencies, we are particular about consistent production internally, so we have all the knowledge necessary for web production in-house, and we also have a management system that can consistently handle everything from strategy to delivery. Armed with these strengths, we are able to avoid unreasonable deadlines and create a healthy work environment by asking clients to have equal relationships.    


#### **Difference from operating company**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
###### In recent years, the comparison between operating companies and contractors has often been a debate as a place for designers, engineers and marketers to work. Therefore, here, I will explain the differences in working styles between general business companies and Bage.    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

###### **General business company**
###### It is a general term for companies that run their own businesses. There are a wide variety of industries, formats, and scales, but the client is in-house, the delivery time is lenient, and you can work relatively comfortably. One of the merits of working at a business company is that it is close to the business side. However, I often continue to be  involved in one business, and if I work for a business company when I am inexperienced, I may not be able to acquire a wide range of skills. In addition, since design and web production are not the main business for business companies, evaluation has not been established, and there is a possibility that organizational shrinkage or relocation may occur due to changes in the business environment.    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

###### **General contractor**
###### It is a general web production company, design company, system development company. The client is an outside company. In addition to specialized knowledge, the ability to build relationships with customers is also important, and working at a company that cannot choose customers tends to be exhausting. The business content is limited to specific fields such as design and systems, and there are few opportunities to be involved in the upstream. On the other hand, you can gain a wealth of experience in specialized areas such as design and systems. It also has a culture rooted in design and systems, and is familiar with education. Since production and development are the main business entities, it is unlikely that a sudden change of occupation will occur.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
###### **In the case of Bage**
###### Since we are a web production company, we naturally have a strong character as a contractor. However, depending on the work style, such as strengthening marketing power, increasing inquiries and selecting customers, taking the initiative by taking a consulting type / proposal type stance, and improving management to prevent project confusion, the contractor company Minimizes prone problems. There are many opportunities to learn about business because we are deeply involved with customers and can propose strategies to management. Career paths from designers and engineers also exist within the company.
