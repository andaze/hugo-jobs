##### **`Message to Applicants`**

###### At Baisi, information sharing within the company is very active. In addition to discussing technical issues with other engineers, we can also learn about the company's expertise in website production, which is very helpful in broadening our horizons as engineers. Also, since there are only a few of us, one engineer can be in charge of everything from the front-end to the server-side. Although it is sometimes difficult to be in charge of all the implementation, it is a great way to deepen your knowledge of the web, which will lead to further improvement of your skills.
