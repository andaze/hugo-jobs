#### `--Why did you decide to join Andaze?`
There are many reasons. I was greatly attracted to the work environment and the company culture: working on interesting projects, using the latest and most popular technologies for development, and having experienced and cooperative senior staff who were flexible and helpful.

#### `--Growth and change after joining the company`
When I first joined the company, I was a university student, so I was involved in software development as a part-time employee. Then, from February 2021, I have been working as a full-time regular employee in an engineering position. My main role is to design, develop, and maintain full-fledged web applications. During this time, I also had the opportunity to work on AI-related projects. With time, my technical knowledge has increased, and I feel that I am growing as a team player who can efficiently and quickly respond to new things.

#### `--Message to Applicants`
Andaze is a progressive company with a good work environment and allows remote work. I feel that the opinions and ideas of employees like me can be freely expressed and are respected. In the rapidly changing IT industry, it is very important to keep up with the latest technologies and tools. You will be able to adapt to the changes of the next generation by taking on new challenges.
